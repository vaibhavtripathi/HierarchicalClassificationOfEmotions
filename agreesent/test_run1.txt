Sa	The poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they were addressed to him; he knew not that there were others who were equally ignorant.
Sa	Then the king, in his melancholy, wandered out to the spot in the wood.
H	And the old grandfather nodded again; and the more he looked at Holger Danske, the more satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him.
Sa	The old grandfather wiped his eyes, for he had known King Frederick, with his silvery locks and his honest blue eyes, and had lived for him, and he folded his hands and remained for some time silent.
Sa	They ran on a little farther, and then Christina fell down, and began to cry.
F	Presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood; it was an ugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before them, in the thickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful blackberries, in wonderful quantities.
F	So they went on, but the road led them out of the way; no house could be seen, it grew dark, and the children were afraid.
Sa	At last they both lost themselves in the thicket; Christina began to cry, and then Ib cried too; and, after weeping and lamenting for some time, they stretched themselves down on the dry leaves and fell asleep.
Su	Great quantities of fish could be seen through the clear water, sparkling in the sun's rays; they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon such an unexpected sight.
H	He could not utter a word; he could only seize her hand and hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy and glad to open his lips.
H	His eyes brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: "Christina, if you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live in my mother's house as my wife, we will be married some day.
H	I can trust you, for I believe that I do love you.
Sa	At first Ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- "Christina must not refuse this good fortune."
Sa	Very little was said about the matter to Ib, and he did not refer to it; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very silent and pensive.
Sa	At last a very little girl came out of one of the wretched-looking houses, and Ib asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted; she looked up timidly at him, and began to cry bitterly.
Sa	Her youngest child, looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; and at last Christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed.
Sa	It makes me unhappy to think that I shall die, and leave this poor child," sighed she.
A	The Grasshopper only sprang half as high, but he sprang straight into the King's face, and the King declared that was horribly rude.
Sa	And then he sang his own melancholy song, and from that we have gathered this story, which they say is not true, though it's in print.
H	"Everything around me is so wonderfully bright and warm, and beautiful, that it makes me joyous."
H	You may have thousands of my days, but I have thousands of moments in which I can be merry and happy.
H	And the little creature danced and floated in the air, rejoicing in her delicate wings of gauze and velvet, rejoicing in the balmy breezes, laden with the fragrance of clover-fields and wild roses, elder-blossoms and honeysuckle, from the garden hedges, wild thyme, primroses, and mint, and the scent of all these was so strong that the perfume almost intoxicated the little fly.
H	The long and beautiful day had been so full of joy and sweet delights, that when the sun sank low it felt tired of all its happiness and enjoyment.
H	The same thing was continued through many generations of Ephemera; all of them felt equally merry and equally happy.
H	Once, but long years had intervened since then, guitars and Eolian harps had been hung on his boughs by merry travellers; now they seemed to hang there again, and he could hear their marvellous tones.
H	Then it seemed as if new life was thrilling through every fibre of root and stem and leaf, rising even to the highest branches.
H	As he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself.
Sa	The grand, majestic oak could not be quite happy in the midst of his enjoyment, while all the rest, both great and small, were not with him.
H	At length his longing was satisfied.
H	May beetles hummed, the bees murmured, the birds sang, each in his own way; the air was filled with the sounds of song and gladness."
H	"Why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed," said the oak in a joyful tone.
H	Can such happiness be imagined?"
H	Thus sounded the old Christmas carol, and every one on board the ship felt his thoughts elevated, through the song and the prayer, even as the old tree had felt lifted up in its last, its beautiful dream on that Christmas morn.
Sa	Tears of sorrow rolled down their cheeks, and fell in heavy drops on the floor, but not a word was spoken.
Sa	With silent steps, still sobbing, they left the room.
H	They looked at Little Claus ploughing with his five horses, and he was so proud that he smacked his whip, and said, "Gee-up, my five horses."
H	"I promise you I will not say it any more," said the other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing him "Good day," he became so pleased, and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried out again, "Gee-up, all my horses!"
Sa	"Oh, now I have no horse at all, said Little Claus, weeping.
F	When she heard the farmer coming she was frightened, and begged the sexton to hide himself in a large empty chest that stood in the room.
H	So the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which she had hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry.
H	"I should like to see him now, while I am so merry."
F	"Will you come and help me hold it?" said the farmer, going towards the chest in which his wife had hidden the sexton, who now lay inside, very much frightened.
A	"Skins, skins!" they cried, mocking him; "yes, we'll mark your skin for you, till it is black and blue."
Sa	She had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again.
A	Again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for she was only seated there, not tied in.
F	Great Claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery, jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home quickly.
Sa	"And I, poor fellow," said the drover, "I who am so old already, cannot get there."
H	"Yes, if I only knew a fresh one," said the old man, and nodded smilingly.
H	He was an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here.
H	I tore it open and read it; I cried and laughed at the same time, and was so happy!
H	The elder-tree smelt strongly, and the setting sun illuminated the faces of the two old people, so that they looked quite rosy; the youngest of the grandchildren danced round them, and cried merrily that there would be a feast in the evening, for they were to have hot potatoes; and the elder mother nodded in the tree and cried 'Hooray' with the others."
H	She and the boy kissed each other, and then they were of the same age and felt the same joys.
H	"You must know that as soon as the king and all the court are gone into the town, the flowers run out of the garden into the castle, and you should see how merry they are.
H	It was saying, 'You are so pretty, I like you very much.'
H	"Oh how funny!" said Ida, and she laughed.
A	He did not like the student, and would grumble when he saw him cutting out droll or amusing pictures.
A	But the lawyer did not like such jokes, and he would say as he had just said, "How can anyone put such nonsense into a child's head! what absurd fancies there are!"
A	So she took the doll out, who looked quite cross, and said not a single word, for she was angry at being turned out of her bed.
H	They did not look ill at all now, but jumped about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little Ida.
A	All at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and said to the paper flowers, "How can you put such things in a child's head? they are all foolish fancies;" and then the doll was exactly like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow and as cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs, and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll.
H	This was very amusing, and Ida could not help laughing.
Su	Then Sophy raised himself, and looked round quite astonished, "There must be a ball here to-night," said Sophy.
H	Then Sophy was very happy, and said they might keep her bed; she did not mind lying in the drawer at all.
A	"You are not kind at all," said Ida; "and yet they all danced with you."
Sa	Shivering with cold and hunger, she crept along; poor little child, she looked the picture of misery.
H	She took the little girl in her arms, and they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth, where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain, for they were with God.
H	Here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water.
Sa	The tiny little creature woke very early in the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf, and no way of reaching the land.
Sa	"Croak, croak, croak," was all her son could say for himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept.
Sa	She could not bear to think of living with the old toad, and having her ugly son for a husband.
Sa	As soon as they caught sight of her, they saw she was very pretty, and it made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the ugly toads.
H	Tiny pleased him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold.
F	Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the cockchafer flew with her to the tree!
Sa	Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her.
Sa	She felt dreadfully cold, for her clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate, that poor little Tiny was nearly frozen to death.
H	She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, "You are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall like to hear them very much."
H	And Tiny did all the field-mouse asked her, and found herself very comfortable.
Sa	It made little Tiny very sad to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so beautifully.
Su	Then she laid her head on the bird's breast, but she was alarmed immediately, for it seemed as if something inside the bird went "thump, thump."
F	Tiny trembled very much; she was quite frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal larger than herself,- she was only an inch high.
H	The whole winter the swallow remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love.
Sa	Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes.
Sa	"Tweet, tweet," sang the bird, as he flew out into the green woods, and Tiny felt very sad.
Sa	But Tiny was not at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole.
Sa	Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the disagreeable mole.
Sa	The poor child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful sun, and as the field-mouse had given her permission to stand at the door, she went to look at it once more.
H	As soon as he spied Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more.
Sa	And as she told him she wept.
H	"That will be delightful," she said, and clapped her little hands for joy.
H	The little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird, who was like a giant, compared to such a delicate little creature as himself; but when he saw Tiny, he was delighted, and thought her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen.
H	But I am fragrant with perfume, for close to my gates most lovely roses bloom."
H	The old washerwoman put her head in at the door, and nodded to him quite kindly, and said, "Many thanks, you good child, for your help yesterday.
H	"I know where it blooms," said a happy mother, who came with her lovely child to the bedside of the queen.
Sa	She wept over it, kissed it, and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in that hour of her anguish."
Sa	Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps.
H	He seemed a merry fellow.
H	He looked very jovial, did little work, and had the more holidays.
H	How pretty she was! and such a singer! not a theatre singer, nor a ballad singer; no, but a singer of the woods; for she wandered through the gay green forest, and had a concert there for her own amusement.
Sa	He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out.
H	The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid.
H	One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.
H	The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule.
F	Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother; she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had not done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty.
Sa	Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.
Sa	Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.
H	A little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the Metal Pig.
Sa	He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.
H	So the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry.
H	They stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.
F	A fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so much as did the little dog in this place.
Sa	Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and the boy wept.
H	Then there was great rejoicing, and the painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number of pictures.
H	Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done.
H	He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value.
H	The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much.
H	The sun shone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth the loveliest fragrance, and all felt as we do when we are filled with joy at the thought of our happiness.
A	I am heartily tired of such neighbours."
H	"We make it lively about the house," said the sparrow-mother; "and people say that a swallows' nest brings luck; so they are glad of us.
H	But they were very pleased with it, and wondered whether all the little sparrows could become nightingales.
F	The horse-hair was drawn tightly round her leg- as tightly as if the latter were to be cut off; she was in great pain and terror.
H	He was a merry old man, always wandering about.
F	At these words an icy shudder ran through the sparrow-mother.
F	But she, trembling in every limb, did not think of the adornment.
F	"Now you will see the gold-jacket fly," said the old man, letting the sparrow go, which flew away in deadly fear, with the sun shining upon her.
Su	All the sparrows, and even a crow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was.
F	Driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was almost sinking fainting to the earth, while the flock of pursuing birds increased, some even attempting to peck at her.
A	Then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest.
A	There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.
A	And the eyes of all sparkled with malice.
H	The roses nodded; they recognized their grey neighbours and were pleased to see them again.
H	The books travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands of the emperor; and he sat in his golden chair, and, as he read, he nodded his approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city, his palace, and his gardens.
H	Then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me."
H	"With the greatest pleasure," said the nightingale, and began to sing most delightfully.
H	The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.
H	The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently rewarded already.
H	So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song; and for that same reason it pleased them better.
Sa	Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it.
Sa	Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole court thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to his successor.
H	These are the jewels that rejoice a singer's heart.
H	I will sit on a bough outside your window, in the evening, and sing to you, so that you may be happy, and have thoughts full of joy.
Su	The servants now came in to look after the dead emperor; when, lo! there he stood, and, to their astonishment, said, "Good morning."
H	She said this merrily, for she was the best of the hens, and, moreover, as had been said, very respectable.
A	If I were a cock, I should despise her."
A	The hen who had lost the loose little feather naturally did not recognise her own story, and being a respectable hen, said: "I despise those fowls; but there are more of that kind.
A	He's angry to-day.
H	"'Could I but have my love, Who then so happy as Glove!
Sa	And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.
Sa	If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.
H	Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and were soon both very busy and eager about it.
Sa	And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.
H	One stanza pleased him exceedingly-
A	Hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips, and we feel the same sensation if we kiss either; and Anthony's kiss was now the kiss of hatred, as it had once been the kiss of love.
Sa	Sorrow and suffering deprived Anthony's father of his strength, so that he had something else to think of besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly.
Sa	How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!
Sa	There lay the old bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself.
H	The fragrant leaves of the tree fell upon him and cooled his burning brow; upon his parched lips they seemed like refreshing bread and wine; and as they rested on his breast, a peaceful calm stole over him, and he felt inclined to sleep.
H	In that solemn hour the sweet and joyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwelling with thankfulness and trust; and when, amidst these joyous sounds, a little son was born to them, the words of prayer and praise arose from their overflowing hearts, and their happiness seemed to ring out over town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells' chime.
H	Its parents kissed it lovingly, and the father wrote these words in the Bible, "On the tenth of November, 1759, God sent us a son."
Sa	He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the cross for us all.
H	His mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her.
Sa	A record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow.
Sa	Dark days and cold nights also passed over the old bell, and it noticed them not; but the bell in the man's heart felt it to be a gloomy time.
Sa	The corpse lay in a bedroom, near to the one in which we sat, and the old man was in great distress and weeping like a child.
Sa	He spoke to my father, and to a few neighbors who were there, of how lonely he should feel now she was gone, and how good and true she, his dead wife, had been during the number of years that they had passed through life together, and how they had become acquainted, and learnt to love each other.
H	And then he talked of his wedding-day; and his eyes brightened, and he seemed to be carried back, by his words, to that joyful time.
H	And the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and then he carried the tin soldier into the house.
H	"Oh," replied the old man, "I have pleasant thoughts of all that has passed, recalled by memory; and now you are come to visit me, and that is very pleasant."
Sa	"I cannot endure it," said the tin soldier, who stood on a shelf, "it is so lonely and dull here.
H	Then the old man came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought no more of the tin soldier.
H	How happy and delighted the little boy was; and after he returned home, and while days and weeks passed, a great deal of nodding took place from one house to the other, and then the little boy went to pay another visit.
Sa	"I cannot bear it any longer," said the tin soldier; "I have wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy here.
H	Then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it, and said, "Ah, she could sing that tune."
H	The sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together as loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents were very proud of him.
H	"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."
H	"Yes, terribly lonely," cried the tin soldier; "still it is delightful not to be forgotten."
Sa	He bent his head mournfully, and sighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet spirit might sigh.
Sa	Song doth not carry them forth over the lands, nor into the hearts of men; therefore I have no rest and no peace."
H	Then the face of the dead one gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight.
H	How sweetly they sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them!
A	"Well, then, why do you lie in my way?" she retorted, "you must not be so touchy.
A	I have nerves of my own, but I do not cry 'tweet.'"
A	When madam awoke afterwards, there he stood before her with a little corn he had found, and laid it at her feet; but as she had not slept well, she was naturally in a bad temper.
A	Don't stand there, looking so stupid."
A	"Impertinent creature!" exclaimed the Portuguese duck: "would you compare me with the cat- that beast of prey?
A	"You'll kill me with your crowing," she cried, "it's all your fault.
Sa	"We shall never have another singing-bird again amongst us; he was almost a Chinese," they whispered, and then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound, that all the other fowls clucked too, but the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards.
A	"Justice must still be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee; but that the snail should have received the second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself" "No," said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes; "there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance.
A	But I do not understand chattering and boasting; on the contrary, I despise it."
A	And the snail spat at them with contempt.
F	She was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes away; but they stuck fast.
F	"Mercy!" cried Karen.
F	And she went quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back.
Sa	During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears, but when Sunday came again she said: "Now I have suffered and striven enough.
F	Then she became terrified, and turned back and repented right heartily of her sin.
Sa	On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she was asked whether she wished to go too; but, with tears in her eyes, she looked sadly at her crutches.
Sa	Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: "O God! help me!"
A	"What! is he going to propose to me?" said the scissors, and she became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar, and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless.
H	"Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight," she exclaimed, while her eyes sparkled.
H	The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then tripped away over the snow with her friend.
F	"But we are very much frightened," said the young storks, and they drew back their heads into the nests.
Su	"Oh, o- h!" cried the young storks.
A	The young storks were very angry, and grew worse as they grew older; so at last their mother was obliged to promise that they should be revenged, but not until the day of their departure.
H	The emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall where the princess was just playing "Visitors are coming" with her ladies-in-waiting; when she saw the large cases with the presents therein, she clapped her hands for joy.
Sa	"You are right," said the emperor, and began to cry like a little child.
H	When the princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune, she stopped and looked quite pleased, for she also could play it- in fact, it was the only tune she could play, and she played it with one finger.
H	That was a pleasure!
H	The ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy.
A	"Go out of my sight," said the emperor, for he was very angry; and both the princess and the swineherd were banished from the empire.
Sa	There she stood and cried, the swineherd scolded her, and the rain came down in torrents.
Sa	Oh, how wretched I am!"
A	"Ugh, you beast!" said the farm laborer who emptied the bucket, when he saw the toad.
H	She was glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.
H	Yes, I shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy!
Sa	Far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes.
Sa	Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail?
Sa	I suppose he is under the ground now; and Ida- alas! alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that I am!
H	It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back.
H	However, he passed a very pleasant time; went to the theatre, drove in the king's garden, and gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very good of him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling.
H	Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman, and all this gratified him exceedingly.
Su	"And here is one, and there is another!" they all exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction.
H	The shoemaker's boy liked the idea of getting the four shillings, so he ran very fast and fetched the tinder-box, and gave it to the soldier.
H	The princess came out of the copper castle, and became queen, which was very pleasing to her.
A	But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even condescend to reply.
Sa	"I know very well where she is," sighed the top; "she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."
Su	"Ah," she exclaimed, "here is a gilt top."
Su	The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others.
Sa	"He is too big," they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard.
Sa	Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.
F	How they terrified the poor duckling!
H	She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child.
Sa	So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.
Sa	All this was very sad for the poor little duckling.
Su	The duckling had never seen any like them before.
H	Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement.
F	The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room.
F	Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more.
Sa	The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.
H	He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.
H	"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."
H	Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, "I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling."
A	At last the prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches, on the altars, but in this the priests opposed him, saying: "Prince, you are mighty indeed, but God's power is much greater than yours; we dare not obey your orders."
A	They buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats.
A	Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.
