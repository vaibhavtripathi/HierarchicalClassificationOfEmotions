And the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees before him, and said, "O dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for I always loved you very much.
So they were married, and lived together very happily till they died.
Each wanted to be first at drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home.
Then she was much grieved, and went to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what had become of them.
So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.
When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each other, and went merrily home.
At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy, and asked: "Do you know where my husband is?
She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the boy"s father, "Your boy," cried she, "has been the cause of a great misfortune!
He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his leg.
Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house."
"What wicked tricks are these?" said he.
Go out of my sight.
I will see you no more."
If you are cold, come and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves."
Ah! now I know what it is to shudder!"
"The old woman has destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at once, and took their lives.
But when she had reached the middle, and heard the water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still, and ventured no farther.
The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.
"Lord have mercy on us!" cried the father; "is that all you have learnt?
Then the father fell into a rage and said: "Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes?
The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he begged for a night"s lodging.
He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad.
Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon."
"Oh," said the ass, "by all means go with us to the great city; you are a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician."
The cat was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.
"With all my heart," said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.
"Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry."
The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to eat again for a month.
After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at this very day.
But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away.
As soon as the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, "Good morning! good morning to thee, my friend!"
When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed heartily; and the eldest said, "This fellow too might have done a wiser thing than lose his life in this way!"
Then they rose up and opened their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager to begin dancing.
But the youngest said, "I don"t know how it is, while you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will befall us."
The soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, "All is not right; someone took hold of my gown."
Then the youngest daughter said again, "I am sure all is not right--did not you hear that noise?
And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.
At this, too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always silenced her.
The son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: "Yes, dear father, your will shall be done," and thereupon the king shut his eyes, and died.
His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died.
The king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off.
Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said: "You are mine, and I am yours, and no one in the world can alter that."
The giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: "Three tailors rode forth from the gate," as if carrying the tree were child"s play.
But he did not venture to give him his dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people dead, and place himself on the royal throne.
"I"ll put a screw into that business," said the little tailor.
His sons were very much grieved at their father"s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was the matter.
They told him that their father was very ill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him.
"Mind your own affairs, busybody!" said the prince scornfully, and rode on.
Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full of water, and hastened to get away in time.
The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to be put to death.
"He is still alive," said the huntsman; "and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat."
At this the king was overwhelmed with joy, and made it known thoughout all his kingdom, that if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.
So he journeyed on, thinking of her all the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the kingdom.
And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.
And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.
And all the good people they danced and they sung, And feasted and frolick"d I can"t tell how long.
But when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it, so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth.
The king ordered the man to be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked upon as guilty and executed.
In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble.
They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and one said in a pitiful tone: "Something lies heavy on my stomach; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen"s window."
They leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: "We will remember you and repay you for saving us!"
Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: "We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!"
All the people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him alone by the sea.
Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward.
But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another task.
The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.
The youth, full of joy, set out homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king"s beautiful daughter, who had now no more excuses left to make.
They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.
The willow-wren with his army also came flying through the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other.
There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children.
Then the old one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.
The miller thought to himself: "The wolf wants to deceive someone," and refused; but the wolf said: "If you will not do it, I will devour you."
Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him.
They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.
Ah! what a sight she saw there!
Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.
At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.
"Ah, heavens," she said, "is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?"
What rejoicing there was!
They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding.
When the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: "The wolf is dead!
The wolf is dead!" and danced for joy round about the well with their mother.
"How lonely it is, wife," said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, "for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!"
"What you say is very true," said the wife, sighing, and turning round her wheel; "how happy should I be if I had but one child!
So they said, "Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is, we will love him dearly."
When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how to go, crying out, "Go on!" and "Stop!" as he wanted: and thus the horse went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the wood.
"Good night, my masters!" said he, "I"m off! mind and look sharp after me the next time."
He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the cow"s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it.
But he soon found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about him, that he might not get between the cow"s teeth, and so be crushed to death.
"It is rather dark," said he; "they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a candle would be no bad thing."
A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.
And his father said, "Heaven be praised! we have found our dear child again"; and he told his wife not to use the scythe for fear she should hurt him.
Then he aimed a great blow, and struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free.
"Ah!" said the father, "what fears we have had for you!"
"Yes, father," answered he; "I have travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again."
"Well," said they, "you are come back, and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world."
Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.
So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always agreed that, after all, there"s no place like HOME!
"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police," said Pickles.
Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.
He shut the door in Nutkin's face.
Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.
And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--
"I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!" said Duchess to herself--"I really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie.
"Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?" said Duchess.
"I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!"
"Oh, what lovely flowers!
Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!"
"Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my dear Ribby."
But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor--a curious thing had happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.
"How COULD I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!"
She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate.
Duchess started!
"I am truly glad to hear it!
Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home.
Ribby stared with amazement-- "Did you ever see the like! so there really WAS a patty-pan?
Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted and mewed dreadfully.
But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.
Mittens ran away to the dairy and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.
I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby," said Tabitha, shedding tears.
"He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea.
"The chimney wants sweeping-- Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!
"Yes, it is infested with rats," said Tabitha tearfully.
"The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby," said Tabitha.
She seemed to be in a terrible fright.
"Oh, Mother, Mother!" said Mittens--
"Oh!
Oh, my poor son Thomas!" exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.
Tom Kitten was getting very frightened!
There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.
I wish I had never come!
"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?" said the rat, chattering his teeth.
"Nonsense!
While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help.
Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.
Tom Kitten bit and spit, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling pin went roly-poly, roly; roly-poly, roly.
Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw, and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!
As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted.
It feels sad.
And then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!
But she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it-- there was no Mouse!
He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on top of the cupboard!
The tailor replied: "Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to a ravelling.
Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--
"This is passing extraordinary!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down.
But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked: "Where is my MOUSE?"
"Alack, I am undone!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to bed.
The poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled: "No more twist! no more twist!"
The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune--
"Alack," said the tailor, "I have my twist; but no more strength--nor time--than will serve to make me one single buttonhole; for this is Christmas Day in the Morning!
Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.
Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.
Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.
Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home.
Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!
The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.
When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.
Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.
She rather fancied a tree stump amongst some tall foxgloves.
But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.
Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.
Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers.
The foxy gentleman admired them immensely.
When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.
Jemima became much alarmed.
"What a mercy that was not a pike!" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off.
Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.
And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke ..........
He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her ears, and slapped him.
What a nasty person!" said Peter.
He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with laughing.--"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!" said Benjamin Bunny.
When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went cautiously.
The rabbits crept up carefully, listening and peeping.
The rabbits shivered in their shoes.
The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!
Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.
Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely.
Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers.
First he had been upset by breaking the plate.
Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.
He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger.
Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to.
He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently.
The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod furious.
His whiskers bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage.
When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury.
The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also-- grinning immensely.
At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.
He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.
Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen.
They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously.
The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.
But Benjamin was frightened--
"Oh; oh! they are coming back!"
After quarreling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast.
In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amidst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust.
Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family.
One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!
A little frightened voice called out "Who's that?"
There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.
Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap-where Lucie had yellow curls-that little person had PRICKLES!
"Oh that IS lovely!" said Lucie.
And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
"Go away, you bold bad spider!
Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely.
Mrs. Tittle- mouse began to get cross.
"I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.
He was sitting all over a small rocking chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails.
"Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
Now what I really--REALLY should like-- would be a little dish of honey!"
"Get out, you nasty old toad!" shrieked Babbitty Bumble.
"I shall go distracted!" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.
But the untidiness was something dreadful--"Never did I see such a mess--smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown--and marks of big and little dirty feet-- all over my nice clean house!"
But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!
Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.
Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.
Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.
Peter began to cry.
The eight little pigs had very fine appetites--"Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they DO eat!" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride.
Suddenly there were fearful squeals; Alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.
Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland's nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander's nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot.
Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows--
Pigling Bland who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.
Alexander went into squeals of laughter.
Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.
But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing--
Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.
Pigling Bland became frightened and cried "Wee, wee, wee!
I can't find my way home!"
He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside --"I am afraid it IS a hen house, but what can I do?" said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out.
"Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!" scolded the disturbed cockerel.
Pigling Bland, much alarmed, determined to leave at daybreak.
A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.
Pig-wig looked anxious.
"I thought you had eaten them?" said Pigling, waking suddenly.
I have tooth- ache," said Pigling much dismayed.
He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of Mr. Piperson overhead.
