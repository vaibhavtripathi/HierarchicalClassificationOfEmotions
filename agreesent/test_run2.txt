H	She dropped Pigling's hand and commenced to dance, singing-- presently.
A	Pigling Bland refused quite crossly.
F	And in sight of the bridge!" said poor Pigling, nearly crying.
H	They came to the river, they came to the bridge--they crossed it hand in hand--then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!
H	They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.
H	The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun.
H	The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.
Su	What's that?
A	When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry.
A	And Mr. McGregor was very angry too.
Sa	Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him.
H	It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story.
F	My wife will be anxious!"
H	Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled.
F	Chippy Hackee went home in a hurry!
Su	They had very small eyes and looked surprised.
H	Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall.
H	"It's a very fine morning!" said Mr. Drake Puddle-duck.
A	She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.
A	"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted," said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.
F	Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug.
H	Then they squeaked with joy!
A	Then Tom Thumb lost his temper.
A	Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca.
A	But inside the church the pastor stood in the pulpit, and spoke very loudly and angrily.
A	He spoke very excitedly, saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed, nor would the fire be extinguished, and they should never find rest.
F	It was dreadful to hear all that, for the preacher spoke from his heart, and all the people in the church were terrified.
A	And the blood rose to the head of the excited criminal; he threw himself upon his comrade, and beat him with his clenced fist in the face.
F	The pastor's hand trembled; he dared not stretch it out, he did not venture to pull a hair out of the sinner's head.
H	It became a splendid flower-garden to the sick boy, and his little treasure upon earth.
H	The flower entwined itself even in his dreams- for him it bloomed, for him spread its perfume.
H	And it gladdened his eyes, and to the flower he turned, even in death, when the Lord called him.
Sa	During that time the flower has stood in the window, withered and forgotten, till at length cast out among the sweepings into the street, on the day of the lodgers' removal.
H	Then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorious happy face of the angel, and at the same moment they found themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy.
H	Then it joined in the song of the angels, who surrounded the throne, some near, and others in a distant circle, but all equally happy.
H	They all joined in the chorus of praise, both great and small,- the good, happy child, and the poor field-flower, that once lay withered and cast away on a heap of rubbish in a narrow, dark street.
Sa	Then he would cry, but what nobody knows nobody cares for; so he would cry till he was tired, and then fall asleep; and while we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst.
H	Her beautiful, noble child had been a dear angel, and possessed the kindest heart; he had loved her so much, and she had loved him in return; they had kissed and loved each other, and the boy had been her joy, her second life.
Sa	Anne Lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road, feeling mournful and sad; he whom she had nursed day and night, and even now carried about in her dreams, had been cold and strange, and had not a word or thought respecting her.
Sa	She felt very low-spirited, because her count-child had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well, and who had travelled so far to see him.
F	Only tangled grass, and yet she was frightened at it.
F	As these thoughts passed through her mind, fear gave speed to her feet, so that she walked faster and faster.
F	Fear came upon her as if a cold, clammy hand had been laid upon her heart, so that she almost fainted.
F	It was the first hour of her awakening, full of anguish and horror.
F	Superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or burn with the heat of fever.
F	"A grave! dig me a grave!" still sounded in her ears; she was fearful that the cock might crow, and the first red streak appear in the east, before she had finished her work; and then she would be lost.
H	"Now I am in the house of God," she said, "and in that house we are happy."
Su	"A difference!" cried the sunbeam, as he kissed the blooming apple-branch, and then kissed the yellow dandelion out in the fields.
H	There came presently across the fields a whole group of children, the youngest of whom was so small that it had to be carried by the others; and when he was seated on the grass, among the yellow flowers, he laughed aloud with joy, kicked out his little legs, rolled about, plucked the yellow flowers, and kissed them in childlike innocence.
H	Mr. Alfred again spoke of Italy, and of the glorious colors in Italian scenery; the purple hills, the deep blue of the Mediterranean, the azure of southern skies, whose brightness and glory could only be surpassed in the north by the deep-blue eyes of a maiden; and he said this with a peculiar intonation; but she who should have understood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it, which also was charming.
H	The young man felt the truth of the proverb, "Still waters run deep:" and his heart had sunk into their depths.
Su	"Good heavens!" she exclaimed.
Su	He placed a pencil sketch on the table; and mamma, who had been over-powered with the appearance of the colored plates, threw a glance at the pale drawing and cried in astonishment, "What, did you see it throw up white fire?"
H	The betrothed pair were very happy, and the mother was happy too.
A	"There is no real pleasure in travelling," said mamma; "to tell the truth, it's very wearisome; I beg pardon for saying so.
A	I was soon very tired of it, although I had my children with me; and, besides, it's very expensive work travelling, very expensive.
A	And all those galleries one is expected to see, and the quantity of things you are obliged to run after!
A	It must be done, for very shame; you are sure to be asked when you come back if you have seen everything, and will most likely be told that you've omitted to see what was best worth seeing of all.
A	I got tired at last of those endless Madonnas; I began to think I was turning into a Madonna myself."
A	"Yes, indeed," she replied, "no such a thing as a respectable meat soup- their cookery is miserable stuff."
Sa	Alfred wept, and mamma wept, and they both wore mourning.
Sa	She had also to experience another grief in seeing Alfred marry again, marry Sophy, who was nothing at all to look at.
A	"He's gone to the very extreme," said mamma-in-law; "he has gone from the most beautiful to the ugliest, and he has forgotten his first wife.
H	"'Pygmalion loved his Galatea,' was in the song they sung at my first wedding," said Alfred; "I once fell in love with a beautiful statue, which awoke to life in my arms; but the kindred soul, which is a gift from heaven, the angel who can feel and sympathize with and elevate us, I have not found and won till now.
Su	"Understand!
H	"How beautiful this world is!" said the caterpillar.
H	"The sun is so warm, I quite enjoy it.
H	"Wonderful weather this," cried one of them, "and so refreshing.
H	What happiness for a mother!"
H	How charming this is for a mother, is it not Mr. Beetle?" for she knew the stranger by his horny coat.
H	"Certainly," said the beetle, "I shall be most happy; I have been exposed to the rain, and have had to lie upon linen, and cleanliness is a thing that greatly exhausts me; I have also pains in one of my wings from standing in the draught under a piece of broken crockery.
H	The mother gave them her blessing, and all the other beetles cried "hurrah."
A	"Fie on the villain that forsook her!"
H	"What a wonderful quantity of plants," cried the beetle; "how good they will taste when they are decayed!
A	"You speak without knowing the facts," replied the beetle; "don't you see that I am a prisoner?"
A	This vexes me more than anything.
H	"Oh, what a splendour!"
H	And they ran towards each other and took one another's hand, in the great cathedral of nature and poesy, and above them sounded the invisible holy bell; happy spirits surrounded them, singing hallelujahs and rejoicing.
A	Let her be expelled from the congregation and the Church.
A	"Thou child of perdition, I will yet carry out my purpose!" cried the Bishop of Borglum.
H	He seized her hand, he embraced her, and the mother wept.
H	"Safe return, and a wedding this day next year," he cried; and when the glasses were empty he took the bottle, raised it on high, and said, "Thou hast been present here on the happiest day of my life; thou shalt never be used by others!"
H	Those were happy days, and the bottle would sing when rubbed with a cork, and it was called a great lark," "Peter Jensen's lark."
H	For very joy, it felt ready to jump out of people's hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten.
H	"There's no place like home, even if it's a cellar."
H	The rabbit was quite excited because he knew that he was to be taken up, and let down again in a parachute.
H	Then they hung it in the cage of the little bird, who sang and twittered more merrily than ever.
A	But the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said, "Stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his body."
F	"Bend your head as we do," cried the ears of corn; "the angel of the storm is coming; his wings spread from the sky above to the earth beneath.
F	He will strike you down before you can cry for mercy."
Sa	The branches of the old willow-tree rustled in the wind, and large water-drops fell from his green leaves as if the old willow were weeping.
A	But Marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that he should call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a great difference.
H	The pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she was white and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be useful in the kitchen.
Su	"Oh, indeed; and you will be like her some day," said he; and he flew away directly, for he felt quite shocked.
H	"I will take her," said the butterfly; and he made her an offer.
Sa	"It is not very pleasant, certainly; I should imagine it is something like being married; for here I am stuck fast."
Su	As if these things were of any consequence!
Su	Who would trouble themselves about such trifles? especially at a comedy, where every one is expected to be amused.
Sa	The sisters mourned as young hearts can mourn, and were especially grieved at the sight of their parents' sorrow.
Sa	The father's heart was bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under the deep grief.
Sa	She thought God could not take her darling little one from her; and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and her belief, and there could be no more doubt on the subject, she said in her feverish agony, "God does not know it.
Sa	But these doubts were no support to her, nothing on which she could rest, and she sunk into the fathomless depths of despair.
Sa	The tears of her husband fell on her forehead, but she took no notice of him; her thoughts were with her dead child; her whole existence seemed wrapped up in the remembrances of the little one and of every innocent word it had uttered.
Sa	When she awoke, and wanted to see her child, the husband, with tears, said, "We have closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so."
Sa	"When God is so hard to me, how can I expect men to be better?" she said with groans and tears.
Sa	With tearful eyes and mournful glances, the sorrowing daughters and the afflicted husband looked upon her who would not hear their words of comfort; and, indeed, what comforting words could they speak, when they were themselves so full of grief?
Sa	As she had sat by his little cot, so now she sat by his grave; and here she could weep freely, and her tears fell upon it.
A	All this was new and interesting; that is, for the first time, but afterwards, as the weather-cock found out, they repeated themselves and always told the same stories, and that's very tedious, and there was no one with whom one could associate, for one and all were stale and small-minded.
A	"The world is no good!" he said.
A	"Everything in it is so stupid."
A	"Everything is very stupid," the weather-cock said to himself.
A	Everything is so stupid!
A	I don't want to sit here any longer."
H	How rich I am!"
H	Its joy was so great that it did not know what to think.
H	The little bird hopped round it and sang, "How beautifully soft the grass is, and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and silver dress is growing here."
H	How happy the daisy was!
Su	"Ugh!" sighed the daisy, "that is terrible; now they are done for."
Sa	Indeed the poor bird had good reason to be sad, for it had been caught and put into a cage close by the open window.
Sa	The poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage.
Sa	The poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings against the wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word, much as it would have liked to do so.
Sa	Alas! you only remind me of what I have lost."
Sa	The evening came, and nobody appeared to bring the poor bird a drop of water; it opened its beautiful wings, and fluttered about in its anguish; a faint and mournful "Tweet, tweet," was all it could utter, then it bent its little head towards the flower, and its heart broke for want and longing.
Sa	The flower could not, as on the previous evening, fold up its petals and sleep; it dropped sorrowfully.
Sa	The boys only came the next morning; when they saw the dead bird, they began to cry bitterly, dug a nice grave for it, and adorned it with flowers.
H	And there she sat as proudly as if she were in a state coach, and looked all around her.
Sa	Had I still my old eye, which was broken off, I believe I should weep; but no, I would not do that, it is not genteel to cry."
Su	"Good heavens, how it crushes!" said the darning-needle.
H	"Thus the small service done to the old man was richly rewarded!" said Meta Mogen.
H	In the garden grow roses; the mistress of the house is herself the finest rose petal, she beams with joy, the joy of good deeds: however, not done in the wide world, but in her heart, and what is preserved there is not forgotten.
H	The paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see the wood and the lake; the world had become so large, so beautiful, and only through a single word from the kind mistress of the mansion.
H	"The word was so easy, the deed so small," she said, "the joy it afforded me was infinitely great and sweet!"
Sa	A week has passed; this morning his death was in the newspaper, that is the reason of the girl's mourning!
Sa	The black bow signifies mourning, the girl's face points to the same in a still higher degree; it is preserved in the heart and will never be forgotten.
A	And they hacked away at him, and they pulled at him, and ate him up, because of the little bruise.
Su	"It's a drop of puddle water!" said Kribble-Krabble.
Su	I declare you have put on your Sunday clothes!"
Su	"My word!
H	Here I come!" shouted Jack the Dullard, and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide.
H	"Hurrah! it is quite famous."
H	"Oh," said Jack the Dullard, "I can hardly tell you.
A	Then the Princess would say, "He is of no use!
A	Away with him out of the hall!"
A	"He is of no use!" said the Princess.
A	"Away with him!"
A	"Away with him!"
H	"Ah, that's lucky!" exclaimed Jack the Dullard, "for I suppose you'll let me roast my crow at the same time?"
H	"With the greatest pleasure," said the Princess.
H	"I like that!" said the Princess.
H	But she only said this to frighten Jack the Dullard; and the clerks gave a great crow of delight, and each one spurted a blot out of his pen on to the floor.
Sa	"They say that he was once an energetic young man, that he studied the dead languages, and sang and even composed many songs; then something had happened to him, and in consequence of this he gave himself up to drink, body and mind.
Sa	But when we succeeded in bringing him home, and prevailed upon him to open the book with the dried-up plants in it, he would sometimes sit for a whole day looking at this or that plant, while frequently the tears rolled over his cheeks.
Sa	And then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and gave him a rose; but before she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently that the flower opened.
Sa	Oh, what bitter tears she shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief.
Sa	Oh, how she wept and prayed that she also might die!
Sa	Every morning he flew to the window of the poor girl, and always found her weeping by the flower pot.
Sa	The bitter tears fell upon the jasmine twig, and each day, as she became paler and paler, the sprig appeared to grow greener and fresher.
A	"What a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill," said one of the lizards; "I have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; I might just as well have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake."
A	"Feet off the table-cloth!" said the old goblin.
A	"Stop!" cried the old goblin," is that the only house-keeping they can perform?
Su	"Ho! ho!" said the old goblin, "is that what she means?
H	So she took him by the wrist, and he laughed till he nearly choked; and when she came to the fourth finger, there was a gold ring on it, as if it knew there was to be a betrothal.
H	How merry we shall be!
H	But the lizards continued to run up and down the riven tree; and one said to the other, "Oh, how much I was pleased with the old goblin!"
Su	"Heaven preserve us!" he thought, and opened his eyes wide, "I cannot see anything at all," but he did not say so.
H	"We are pleased to hear that," said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern.
Su	"Good heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child," said the father, and one whispered to the other what the child had said.
Sa	FAR down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its companions- the pines and firs which grew around it.
Sa	As the axe cut through the stem, and divided the pith, the tree fell with a groan to the earth, conscious of pain and faintness, and forgetting all its anticipations of happiness, in sorrow at leaving its home in the forest.
F	How the fir-tree trembled!
H	It trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them.
Su	"Help! help!" exclaimed the young ladies, but there was no danger, for they quickly extinguished the fire.
H	For a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after another was taken from it.
H	And then the tree related the whole story; he could remember every single word, and the little mice was so delighted with it, that they were ready to jump to the top of the tree.
H	"Now life is beginning again," said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air.
Sa	The pieces were placed in a fire under the copper, and they quickly blazed up brightly, while the tree sighed so deeply that each sigh was like a pistol-shot.
H	How fortunate I am; it makes me so happy, it is such a pleasant thing to know that something can be made of me.
H	How the sunshine cheers me, and how sweet and refreshing is the rain; my happiness overpowers me, no one in the world can feel happier than I am."
H	I am the happiest of all creatures."
Su	Well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax, and pulled it up by the roots; this was painful; then it was laid in water as if they intended to drown it; and, after that, placed near a fire as if it were to be roasted; all this was very shocking.
H	"Well, this is quite wonderful; I could not have believed that I should be so favored by fortune.
H	How wonderful it is, that after all I have suffered, I am made something of at last; I am the luckiest person in the world- so strong and fine; and how white, and what a length!
H	I cannot be happier than I am now."
H	This was my destiny; it is quite a blessing.
H	Now I shall be of some use in the world, as everyone ought to be; it is the only way to be happy.
H	I am happier than ever."
Su	"Ugh," cried the paper, as it burst into a bright flame; "ugh."
H	Whenever the sun shone, we felt his warm rays, and the little birds would relate stories to us as they sung.
H	"'That is quite true,' said the water-bucket; and he made a spring with joy, and splashed some water on the floor.
H	"The plates rattled with pleasure, and the carpet-broom brought some green parsley out of the dust-hole and crowned the saucepan, for he knew it would vex the others; and he thought, 'If I crown him to-day he will crown me to-morrow.'
H	The street boys stood on tiptoe and shouted "hurrah," and whistled between their fingers; altogether it was a very splendid affair.
A	Then I would clench my fist, and cry, "We will kill these Turks!"
Sa	I saw my poor dead father, and cried till I fell asleep.
Sa	"Sorry!" he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with a grief as deep as my own.
A	But the goblin felt very angry that any man should venture to say such things to a huckster who was a householder and sold the best butter.
H	"My golden treasure, my riches, my sunshine!" said the mother; and she kissed the shining locks, and it sounded like music and song in the room of the drummer; and there was joy, and life, and movement.
Sa	She folded her hands, and hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept.
H	They laughed and they wept; and Peter embraced the old Fire-drum.
Su	"Good Heaven! what's the matter with you?" asked his mother.
Sa	"Nothing, nothing; only leave me to myself," he answered but the tears were running down his cheeks.
Sa	"My sweet child, my golden treasure!" cried the mother, and she wept; but the Fire-drum sang, not out loud, but inwardly.
H	His eyes were as clear and his face was as radiant as sunshine; and he held his mother in his arms, and she kissed his mouth, and wept as blissfully as any one can weep for joy; and he nodded at every old piece of furniture in the room, at the cupboard with the tea-cups, and at the flower-vase.
Su	The counsellor stared with astonishment as he beheld a most strange procession pass before him.
Su	"Good gracious!" he exclaimed; "what in the world has happened to the bishop? what can he be thinking about?"
A	"I don't understand your outlandish talk," he cried at last, angrily turning his back upon them.
Su	"Goodness me! where am I?" said he.
Su	It bewildered him as he thought of it.
H	"Yes, this is East Street; how beautifully bright and gay it looks!
Su	It is quite shocking that one glass of punch should have upset me like this."
Sa	The lieutenant felt this very keenly, and therefore leaned his head against the window-frame, and sighed deeply.
Su	"There goes one!" cried he.
F	He declared, when he quite recovered himself, that this had been the most dreadful night he had ever passed; not for a hundred pounds would he go through such feelings again.
Su	He started back, quite bewildered with the fright which the goloshes of Fortune had caused him.
Su	"Good gracious!" he sighed, "I must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head."
H	It is overpowering, and yet it is delightful."
H	As the clerk thought of all these things, and became conscious of the great change in his own feelings, he smiled, and said to himself, "I must be asleep and dreaming; and yet, if so, how wonderful for a dream to be so natural and real, and to know at the same time too that it is but a dream.
F	The canary-bird fluttered in his cage, and the parrot flapped his wings and cried, "Let us be men;" the poor clerk, in the most deadly terror, flew through the window, over the houses, and through the streets, till at length he was obliged to seek a resting-place.
Su	"Heaven preserve us!" said he; "How did I get up here and fall asleep in this way?
Su	"Dead!" cried the laundress, turning pale as death.
Su	"Is he dead?" she exclaimed.
Sa	Oh, my poor child," and she burst into tears.
Sa	And he, poor boy, wept also, as he sat alone by the river, near to and watching the damp linen.
Sa	I kissed her hand, and wept bitter tears, and I wept still more when I went to my room, and threw myself on the bed.
Sa	"Oh, my poor mother!" he cried, while the tears rolled down his cheeks.
H	She has a hymn-book with large silver clasps, in which she often reads; and in the book, between the leaves, lies a rose, quite flat and dry; it is not so pretty as the roses which are standing in the glass, and yet she smiles at it most pleasantly, and tears even come into her eyes.
H	At her side sits a young man, tall and strong; he gives her a rose and she smiles.
H	She smiled once more, and then people said she was dead.
A	Her Puggie had seated itself on the ground while she wrote, and growled; for the dog had come with her for amusement and for the sake of its health; and then the bare floor ought not to be offered to a visitor.
Sa	She had not a button- that she knew right well, and therefore she remained standing sorrowfully outside, till all the others had seen the grave and had gone away; then she sat down, held her little brown hands before her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl alone had not seen Puggie's grave.
Sa	It was a grief as great to her as any grown person can experience.
H	They lived quite retired and very happily; and as they had no children of their own, they had adopted a little common snail, which they brought up as their own child.
H	I am very glad we have such good houses, and that the little one has one of his own.
H	"There can be nothing better than we have here," said the father-snail; "I wish for nothing more."
A	You need not be in a hurry; you are always so impatient, and the youngster is getting just the same.
H	He will be the joy of our home; and we old folks have nothing else to live for.
A	"There may be black snails, no doubt," said the old snail; "black snails without houses; but they are so vulgar and conceited too.
H	And the rain fell upon the burdock-leaves, to play the drum for them, and the sun shone to paint colors on the burdock forest for them, and they were very happy; the whole family were entirely and perfectly happy.
A	"It must be a kind of garden plant," said another; and so they sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden.
A	"It is stupid nonsense to allow yourself to shoot out in this way; we are not here to support you."
H	With pious gratitude the girl looked upon this glorious work of God, and bent down over one of the branches, that she might examine the flower and inhale the sweet perfume.
H	Then a light broke in on her mind, and her heart expanded.
