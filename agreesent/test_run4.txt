F	One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, "We must take care that we don"t go too near to the fairy"s castle."
F	Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.
Sa	He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain.
Sa	Many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.
H	He ran or flew after her, touched the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when they walked together in the wood.
A	But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door.
A	"Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!" sighed she; "would that I had married King Grisly-beard!"
A	"Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!" said she; "would that I had married King Grisly-beard!"
A	"Ah! wretch that I am!" sighed she; "why did I not marry King Grisly-beard?"
A	"That is no business of mine," said the fiddler: "why should you wish for another husband?
A	Am not I good enough for you?"
Sa	Then she began to cry, and knew not what to do.
Sa	Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly which had brought her so low.
F	All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king"s son in golden clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was making sport of her.
H	Joy was in every face and every heart.
H	The feast was grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you and I had been of the party.
Sa	This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter.
H	"A lucky hit!" said he, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.
F	Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, "It may perhaps be only a cat or a dog."
H	And when Lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him.
H	The wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time.
H	Then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since.
H	But she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.
F	But he would not, and said that it would be a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven long years.
Sa	This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey.
Sa	"Now," thought she to herself, "no aid of man can be of use to me."
Sa	Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she took heart and said, "As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again."
Sa	Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow, and sat herself down and wept.
H	And she rose up and drove them before her, till the bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth and asked her if she would sell the brood.
H	Then the prince took care to throw away the sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been, he knew his beloved wife"s voice, and sprang up, and said, "You have awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent you to me in a lucky hour."
H	There they found their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.
H	Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child.
Sa	One day her mother said to her: "Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good.
H	The wolf thought to himself: "What a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman.
F	When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: "Ah, how frightened I have been!
H	Then all three were delighted.
H	But Red-Cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything to harm her again.
F	She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker"s oven full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, "Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago."
F	The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and turned to run away.
H	The old woman spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter into her service.
Sa	So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began to grow unhappy.
Sa	She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother Holle than with her mother and sister.
Sa	After waiting awhile, she went to Mother Holle and said, "I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own people."
H	Then Mother Holle said, "I am pleased that you should want to go back to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I will take you home myself."
H	Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome.
F	"Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago," cried the loaves as before.
H	The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in return.
A	The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in the mornings and refused to get up.
A	So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her, and told her she might go.
H	The lazy girl was delighted at this, and thought to herself, "The gold will soon be mine."
H	The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed.
H	So from this time forward Sultan had all that he could wish for.
H	Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought: "He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does"; and she said yes, and laid her hand in his.
Sa	The king"s son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower.
Sa	Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.
Sa	Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness.
H	He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.
H	At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the dwarf, and what she had said.
H	"Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?" said the lady slyly.
H	Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much trouble for nothing, and said, "We wish you a very good morning, and a merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!"
Sa	"She sits upstairs in her room, Bewailing her sorrowful doom, Bewailing her trouble so sore, For old Mr Fox is no more."
H	Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still.
A	When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, "Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood, that I may never see her any more."
A	The first said, "Who has been sitting on my stool?"
A	The second, "Who has been eating off my plate?"
A	The third, "Who has been picking my bread?"
A	The fourth, "Who has been meddling with my spoon?"
A	The fifth, "Who has been handling my fork?"
A	The sixth, "Who has been cutting with my knife?"
A	The seventh, "Who has been drinking my wine?"
A	Then the first looked round and said, "Who has been lying on my bed?"
A	And the rest came running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed.
H	And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs in turn, till the night was gone.
F	Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.
A	Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned comb.
F	Then she dressed herself up as a peasant"s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs" cottage, and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, "I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not."
F	"No," said Snowdrop, "I dare not take it."
Sa	So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, "We will never bury her in the cold ground."
Sa	And the birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.
Sa	Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, "We will not part with her for all the gold in the world."
F	"But," said Roland, "I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape if she pursues us."
A	"That shall not help you," cried she, "even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me."
Sa	The poor girl remained there a long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and changed herself into a flower, and thought: "Someone will surely come this way, and trample me down."
Su	He could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it.
Sa	When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither, but the other girls came and took her.
Su	But when she began her song, and it reached Roland"s ears, he sprang up and cried: "I know the voice, that is the true bride, I will have no other!"
H	Then the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and grief came to an end and joy began.
H	"With all my heart," said Partlet, "let us go and make a holiday of it together."
A	While this was passing, a duck came quacking up and cried out, "You thieving vagabonds, what business have you in my grounds?
A	I"ll give it you well for your insolence!" and upon that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily.
A	He now flew into a very great passion, and, suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.
A	Then he was very angry, and went without his supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell down on his head, and killed him on the spot.
F	Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to Chanticleer, "Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I shall be choked."
Sa	Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with him over poor Partlet.
Sa	Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he died too; and so all were dead.
Sa	He sat for a while very sorrowfully, then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which was still half full.
Su	"What my commands are?" replied the soldier, quite astonished.
A	When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: "I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge."
F	The manikin said: "That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill."
A	"Aha! are you there?" cried the soldier, "get to your work at once!
Sa	At last he could bear it no longer; so he took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
Sa	"Because," said the dog, "I am very very hungry, and have nothing to eat."
H	"I have had plenty of meat," answered he, "but I should like to have a piece of bread to eat after it."
Su	And the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.
H	His conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep.
Su	In the morning after he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table.
Su	The good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.
Su	As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and they sat themselves upon the shoemaker"s bench, took up all the work that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all wonder, and could not take his eyes off them.
H	"These little wights have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good turn if we can.
H	The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to watch what the little elves would do.
H	About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted.
H	Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced out at the door, and away over the green.
H	The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward, as long as they lived.
A	"Did not you ask it for anything?" said the wife, "we live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage."
H	"Ah!" said the fisherman, "how happily we shall live now!"
Sa	"Ah!" said the man, dolefully, "my wife wants to live in a stone castle."
H	"Well," said the man, "now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives."
Sa	So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king.
F	So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, "This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done."
F	At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and said:
F	The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.
A	"No," said she, "I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my leave.
F	Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook.
F	They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea upon a few planks.
H	So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe.
H	When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, "One of you shall marry her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be."
Su	Then the king put in a word, and said, "Each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better.
H	And the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again.
A	At last he said: "Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of?
A	Have you the cheek to ask how I am getting on?
A	How many arts do you understand?"
Sa	The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain.
Sa	"Ah!" replied the horse, "justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so."
H	"Here he is, master," said he, "I have got the better of him": and when the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said.
H	As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
Su	But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head of her bed.
H	They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince"s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.
H	"Ah!" said the young man, "that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?"
Su	Then the fox came, and said, "Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet."
Su	So he said, "Yes," and forgot the fox"s counsel, and sat down on the side of the river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went home to the king their master, and said.
H	Then he went to the king, and told him all his brothers" roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the princess given to him again; and after the king"s death he was heir to his kingdom.
H	The wedding was celebrated, and after the king"s death, Dummling inherited his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.
Sa	They loved each other dearly, but sorrowed much that they had no children.
H	"Ah," sighed the woman heavily, "if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow," and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted.
H	Once again the wife stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that she fell on her knees.
Sa	Presently the fruit became round and firm, and she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill.
Sa	A little while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping.
Sa	"If I die, bury me under the juniper-tree."
Sa	Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for her.
Sa	By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later on he married again.
F	"Mother," said the boy, "how dreadful you look!
Sa	"Oh!" she said, "I have knocked off brother"s head," and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.
Sa	But Marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of salt.
Sa	The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.
Sa	Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but weep.
H	"Bird," he said, "what a beautiful song that is you sing!
H	"How lighthearted I feel," said the father, "so pleased and cheerful."
H	"I do feel so happy," said the father, "and how beautifully the sun shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again."
H	"Look, mother," said the man, "at the beautiful bird that is singing so magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious scent of spice in the air!"
H	He went inside, and said, "See, what a splendid bird that is; he has given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself."
H	And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and danced and jumped about in them.
H	"I was so miserable," she said, "when I came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird, and he has given me a pair of red shoes."
H	The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.
H	But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his face and laughed.
F	Then the father started, trembling with fear and horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.
H	At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before.
Sa	Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face.
Sa	Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat, but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at any rate he had had his revenge.
H	Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him, and said, "Are you at last come to set me free?
H	And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him.
H	Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle, the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden Mountain.
H	They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son.
Sa	And thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father; and he began to long to see him once again.
A	At this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son.
Sa	In an instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had broken his word, and bad luck would follow.
A	He did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.
A	But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.
F	Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: "Thank heaven, you are back again!
Su	"Bless me!" cried the miller, and went there and found the wine.
Su	"Upon my word!" cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat.
Su	"That would be a fine thing!" cried the miller, and went there and found the salad.
Su	"That would be a fine thing!" cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.
F	And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller"s wife was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with her.
H	As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf met him, and asked him what made him so merry.
H	"Why, what should make me down-hearted?" said he; "I am sound in health and rich in purse, what should I care for?
H	Then the countryman rejoiced at his good luck, and said, "I like many things better than money: first, I will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly, a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask."
H	Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he was now ten times more so.
H	"Oh, what a pretty bird!" said the miser; "I would give a great deal of money to have such a one."
H	So he took the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his bargain.
A	Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick.
A	At last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck.
A	"No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you." said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.
F	Then the miser said, "Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity"s sake."
A	Then he called to the miser, and said, "Tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only," "I stole it," said the miser in the presence of all the people; "I acknowledge that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly."
F	But the sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird flew out to meet him.
Sa	He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he had seen and heard.
Sa	They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another.
Sa	And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears.
Sa	The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry.
H	Then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.
A	Then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts.
A	When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built, in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into it, and walled up.
F	The cook, however, thought to himself: "If the child has the power of wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble."
H	The two played together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook went out hunting like a nobleman.
F	The thought occurred to him, however, that the king"s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril.
A	So he went out and took the maiden aside, and said: "Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life."
A	The cook once more said: "If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life."
H	Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast.
Sa	Whilst he was sitting there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the king"s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still, or had perished.
A	When the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon.
H	The son said: "Most gracious father, I will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower," and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.
H	She lived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave.
Sa	The aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king"s own heart, and he soon died.
A	Then their brother, who was a little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who were so much wiser, had been unable to get on.
Sa	At last came the little dwarf"s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat down upon a stone and cried.
Sa	She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, "I know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free."
Sa	She found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no avail.
Sa	When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved at heart, and said, "She has no doubt been here and driven away again, and it is now too late for me to save her."
Su	He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it.
F	He thought to himself, "If the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much."
F	However, after a while he summoned up courage and went forward.
F	"I would rather you let that alone," said the man, "for I do not willingly give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to satisfy your hunger."
H	The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and ate and drank to his heart"s content.
Sa	Then he fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away.
Sa	"How shall I be able to get there?" asked the man.
Sa	When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, "I will remain here and wait for her," so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king"s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.
H	When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and cried aloud for joy.
H	Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and she kissed him, and said, "Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow we will celebrate our marriage."
F	There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided for.
Sa	But the girl did not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.
F	When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along.
Sa	"Ah, you poor child," answered the old woman, "what a place for you to come to!
Sa	If I did not take pity on you and save you, you would be lost."
F	The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by the robbers.
F	She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them.
F	The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast.
H	The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, "If all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me."
Sa	"Alas! dear sir," said she, "yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies--man cannot."
H	The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were delighted with the sight and picked up the finest.
Sa	When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him alone on the wild rock, he said, "Alas! what roguery there is in the world!" and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to do.
H	However, he still felt very hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to have found his old shape again.
