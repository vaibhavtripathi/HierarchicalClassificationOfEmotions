Su	He looked around on every side and exclaimed, "Oh, heavens, where am I?"
Sa	Then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, "Here I am quite alone and deserted, how shall I obtain a horse now?"
Sa	"Alas, thou canst not help me."
H	They leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy.
H	Then she opened the door of the small house, and when she had opened it, there stood twelve horses, such horses, so bright and shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them.
A	Then they laughed and said, "Indeed, stupid Hans, where wilt thou get a horse?"
A	Hans went into the parlour, but the miller said he should not sit down to table, for he was so ragged and torn, that they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in.
H	In the morning when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to see them! and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for the poor miller"s boy.
Su	So she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse, and when the miller saw it, he said that such a horse as that had never yet entered his yard.
H	The little tailor did not let himself be frightened away, but was quite delighted, and said, "Boldly ventured is half won."
A	"Eh!" thought he, "what a stupid blockhead I am!
H	When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, "Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?"
A	Then a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the little tailor screwed it tight, and said, "Now wait until I come with the scissors," and he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep.
A	The bear in great fury ran after the carriage.
F	The princess heard him snorting and growling; she was terrified, and she cried, "Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to get thee!"
H	The tailor drove quietly to church, and the princess was married to him at once, and he lived with her as happy as a woodlark.
Sa	They walked the whole day over meadows, fields, and stony places; and when it rained the little sister said, "Heaven and our hearts are weeping together."
Sa	In the evening they came to a large forest, and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the long walk, that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep.
Sa	And now the sister wept over her poor bewitched brother, and the little roe wept also, and sat sorrowfully near to her.
F	The little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt.
F	The maiden was frightened when she saw, not her little roe, but a man come in who wore a golden crown upon his head.
A	Now when she heard that they were so happy, and so well off, envy and hatred rose in her heart and left her no peace, and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune.
Su	The King said, "Ah, heavens! what is this?
Su	"Good heavens!" said the girl, "no strawberries grow in winter!
H	In her joy she hastily gathered her basket full, thanked the little men, shook hands with each of them, and ran home to take her step-mother what she had longed for so much.
A	"Now look at her arrogance," cried the step-sister, "to throw about gold in that way!" but she was secretly envious of it, and wanted to go into the forest also to seek strawberries.
A	"Humph!
A	The maiden looked for strawberries outside, but as she found none, she went angrily home.
A	Then the step-mother was still more enraged, and thought of nothing but how to do every possible injury to the man"s daughter, whose beauty, however, grew daily greater.
H	"Ah, yes, with all my heart," she answered, for she was glad to get away from the mother and sister.
H	Thereupon the King was full of great joy, but he kept the Queen hidden in a chamber until the Sunday, when the baby was to be christened.
Sa	Night fell, and nothing was left for him to do, but to seek a bed in this painful solitude.
F	He might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there, and at last he was forced to make up his mind to spend the night in a tree.
A	"Who are you, and what do you want?" asked the man in a grumbling voice.
A	"Go your way," replied the old man in a surly voice, "I will have nothing to do with runagates; seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere."
Su	The tailor, who had watched the fight with astonishment, was still standing there motionless, when the stag in full career bounded up to him, and before he could escape, caught him up on his great horns.
H	The tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly opened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him in joyful terror.
H	We loved each other so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution never to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives.
Su	As I could not conceive from whence it came, I wanted to summon my waiting-maid who slept in the next room, but to my astonishment I found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown force.
A	My repugnance to his magic arts was, however, so great, that I vouchsafed him no answer.
Sa	I asked him where he had left my brother, and how he had come by this stag, out of whose great eyes I saw tears flowing.
A	I fell into a great rage at this, pulled out a pistol and discharged it at the monster; but the ball rebounded from his breast and went into my horse"s head.
H	Amongst the visions which passed before my eyes, that was the most comforting in which a young man came and set me free, and when I opened my eyes to-day I saw thee, and beheld my dream fulfilled.
H	Her joy was still more increased when her brother, who had killed the magician in the form of the bull, came out of the forest towards them in his human form, and on the self-same day the maiden, in accordance with her promise, gave her hand at the altar to the lucky tailor.
Sa	So the father gave him his blessing, and with great sorrow took leave of him.
Su	"But dost thou know what thou must promise?" said the King.
H	The King came down himself and opened the door, and there he found both strong and well, and rejoiced with them that now all sorrow was over.
Su	He was astonished when he saw them come alone, and asked what had happened to them.
H	And the Queen, when she had received the letter and read it, did as was written in it, and had a splendid wedding-feast prepared, and the King"s daughter was married to the luck-child, and as the youth was handsome and agreeable she lived with him in joy and contentment.
A	His grandmother scolded him.
Su	"Oh!" cried the devil, "what are you doing?"
A	"Ha! what are you doing?" cried the devil angrily.
A	The devil jumped up, roared out, and would have treated her ill if she had not quieted him once more and said, "Who can help bad dreams?"
Su	"Oh, ho!" said the spring, "then I will begin to flow," and began to flow violently.
A	The sight of this made the tailor so angry that he laid hold of the golden footstool, and threw it down to earth through heaven, at the old thief.
Sa	One morning the wood-cutter went out sorrowfully to his work in the forest, and while he was cutting wood, suddenly there stood before him a tall and beautiful woman with a crown of shining stars on her head, who said to him, "I am the Virgin Mary, mother of the child Jesus.
H	In each of them sat one of the Apostles in the midst of a great light, and she rejoiced in all the magnificence and splendour, and the little angels who always accompanied her rejoiced with her.
F	Immediately a great fear fell on her.
F	Her terror too would not quit her, let her do what she might, and her heart beat continually and would not be still; the gold too stayed on her finger, and would not go away, let her rub it and wash it never so much.
Sa	She wanted to cry out, but she could bring forth no sound.
Sa	Here, too, she found a shelter from storm and rain, but it was a miserable life, and bitterly did she weep when she remembered how happy she had been in heaven, and how the angels had played with her.
H	When the Queen rejoiced thereat, the Virgin Mary said, "Is thy heart not yet softened?
F	As he now feared that the step-mother might not treat them well, and even do them some injury, he took them to a lonely castle which stood in the midst of a forest.
H	Then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers, was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed.
H	The brothers were not less delighted to see their little sister, but their joy was of short duration.
Sa	The little sister wept and said, "Can you not be set free?"
A	The King, however, had a wicked mother who was dissatisfied with this marriage and spoke ill of the young Queen.
H	Then she saw that her deliverance was near, and her heart leapt with joy.
F	The kernel, however, was so large that she could not swallow it, and it remained sticking in her throat, so that she was alarmed lest she should be choked.
Sa	Then the cock was so distressed that he cried aloud, and every animal came to lament the little hen, and six mice built a little carriage to carry her to her grave, and when the carriage was ready they harnessed themselves to it, and the cock drove.
Sa	When a stone saw that, it took pity on the little cock, wished to help him, and laid itself over the water.
H	This pleased the Lord, and he went in.
H	When the cloth was laid, the Lord sat down with the man and his wife, and he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces at the table.
H	"Oh, yes," said the man; "if I can have that, too, I should like it very much."
Su	He was very much astonished, and called his wife and said to her, "Tell me, what can have happened?
A	Then at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, "I wish your neck was broken!"
A	And now as he was walking slowly through the sand, and the sun was burning hot at noon-day, he grew quite hot-tempered and angry.
A	Then he really did feel warm.
H	So he got nothing by it but vexation, trouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse; but the poor people lived happily, quietly, and piously until their happy death.
A	Then the miser grew angry, and said, "Oh, but I can"t make any use of you, you strike far too powerfully; what will you have for the one blow?"
H	As he was hungry, and saw the food, he, too, place himself at the table, ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it.
F	She cried, "No, no I cannot bear it," and opened the other window, because drops of perspiration were running down her forehead.
H	And while she was speaking, the child plucked off quite a large apple, and ran to her sisters, saying, "Just taste, my dear little sisters, for never in my life have I tasted anything so delightful."
Sa	Then he was much troubled, and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife.
A	Then the mannikin grew very angry and said he was to do it, but the huntsman would not, and took my dear mannikin, and gave him a thorough beating.
F	Then the mannikin screamed terribly, and cried, "Stop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell thee where the King"s daughters are."
A	Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow.
H	The princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck.
H	And they all rejoiced, and embraced him and kissed him without stopping.
Su	When the princesses saw him they fainted.
A	Hereupon the King was angry, and ordered him to be put in prison at once, because he thought he must have done some injury to the children.
F	When the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste.
A	Then the King grew angry, and ordered his wife to be cast into prison, and therein was she shut up for many long years.
Sa	Hereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true?
Sa	And now there was no one at home but the daughter, and she mourned for her brothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her set forth, for she wished to go in search of her brothers.
H	She rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed.
H	The others, however, went to the old fisherman, and all were glad that they had found each other again, but they hung the bird on the wall.
F	Then they were all terrified, and the King took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again.
Sa	Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her.
Sa	Then she took it, and went to her mother"s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree.
Sa	Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard to let her go.
H	Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the ball.
A	But the mother said, "No, no! you slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go."
H	And then Ashputtel took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.
A	But her mother said, "It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame": and off she went with her two daughters to the ball.
Sa	Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:
H	Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper.
Su	Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him.
A	"No," said he; "there is only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am sure she cannot be the bride."
H	And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and said, "This is the right bride."
Sa	Now this king and queen had plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but though they had been married many years they had no children, and this grieved them very much indeed.
H	Then the queen took pity on the little fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away it lifted its head out of the water and said, "I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter."
H	What the little fish had foretold soon came to pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land.
A	Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge.
A	So she cried out, "The king"s daughter shall, in her fifteenth year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead."
F	However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom should be bought up and burnt.
H	She looked so beautiful that he could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.
H	But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.
H	And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.
Sa	But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said, "Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has golden hair like mine."
Sa	Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died.
Sa	But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife.
Su	When the courtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, "Heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter!
Su	And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, "Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin."
F	Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood.
Su	"Look sharp!" said the king to the huntsmen, "and see what sort of game lies there."
Su	And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again said, "In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep."
F	So the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, "I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on me and take me with you."
Sa	Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully.
H	But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, "I never saw any one half so beautiful."
H	When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before.
F	The cook was frightened when he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, "You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating."
H	Then she ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in, looking like a king"s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her.
H	Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it, and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it.
H	Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then.
H	But the king said, "You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other."
H	And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.
H	A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.
H	"All went off well," answered the cat.
Su	"Top off!" cried the mouse, "that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?"
A	"What does that matter," said the cat, "it is no worse than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called."
H	"Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself," said she, and was quite satisfied with her day"s work.
Su	I never heard the name in my life, I"ll wager anything it is not in the calendar!"
A	"You sit at home," said the cat, "in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that"s because you do not go out in the daytime."
H	"When everything is eaten up one has some peace," said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return home till night.
Su	"All-gone," cried the mouse "that is the most suspicious name of all!
H	From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: "Come, cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we shall enjoy that."
A	"Yes," answered the cat, "you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window."
Su	"Alas!" said the mouse, "now I see what has happened, now it comes to light!
Su	You a true friend!
A	First top off, then half-done, then--" "Will you hold your tongue," cried the cat, "one word more, and I will eat you too."
Sa	Then said the maid: "What a clever Elsie we have!" and sat down beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune.
Sa	The boy went down, and there sat Clever Elsie and the girl both weeping together.
Sa	Then said the boy: "What a clever Elsie we have!" and sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly.
Sa	Then said the mother likewise: "What a clever Elsie we have!" and sat down and wept with them.
Sa	But when he got into the cellar, and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and that Elsie"s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very time when it fell down, he cried: "Oh, what a clever Elsie!" and sat down, and likewise wept with them.
H	There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, was quite happy and thought: "You certainly are a pretty girl!"
H	And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: "The cook must know what the food is like."
Sa	Then Gretel called out to her master: "If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their juiciest."
H	She ran down, set a jug, said: "God bless it for you, Gretel," and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.
H	Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round.
H	She touched it with her finger, and said: "Ah! how good fowls are!
Sa	It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!"
H	So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought: "The other must go down too, or else master will observe that something is missing."
H	Then she said: "Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God"s good gifts be spoilt?"
H	So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee.
F	The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could.
A	Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried: "You have invited a fine guest!"
Su	"Why, Gretel?
Su	What do you mean by that?"
Sa	"That"s a nice trick!" said her master, and lamented the fine chickens.
Sa	"If he had but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat."
F	The guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both with him.
A	"That was ill done, Hans.
A	"That"s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in your pocket."
A	"That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your head."
A	"That was ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall."
A	"That was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her."
F	The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: "That is the first thief," and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said to his comrade outside: "The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he said I was the first."
F	The second did not want to go in at all, but was forced.
F	This servant was equally alarmed, and he got out as fast as he could.
F	On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment.
F	Then the fellow in the stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out, crying: "That man knows everything!"
Sa	"She is sitting in her room, Moaning in her gloom, Weeping her little eyes quite red, Because old Mr Fox is dead."
H	So when Frederick and Catherine came down, there they found all their money safe and sound.
F	Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together."
H	Then the children went home together, and were heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.
H	Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,
H	"No care and no sorrow, A fig for the morrow!
H	We"ll laugh and be merry, Sing neigh down derry!"
Su	Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side.
H	"Well," said the shepherd, "if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it myself."
H	"What a noble heart that good man has!" thought he.
H	Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one.
H	"If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?"
Su	While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless.
H	"Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!" said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg.
H	So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.
H	The countryman stopped to ask what was o"clock; this led to further chat; and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and how all the world went gay and smiling with him.
H	Then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while Hans went on the way homewards free from care.
H	"After all," thought he, "that chap is pretty well taken in.
H	How happy my mother will be!
H	Talk of a pig, indeed!
H	Give me a fine fat goose."
H	"O"er hill and o"er dale So happy I roam, Work light and live well, All the world is my home; Then who so blythe, so merry as I?"
H	Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, "You must be well off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work."
H	"Yes," said the other, "mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that beautiful goose?"
H	"How can you ask?" said Hans; "I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there"s the goose."
H	Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, "Surely I must have been born in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.
H	People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains."
Su	So he laid the stone carefully by his side on the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.
H	"How happy am I!" cried he; "nobody was ever so lucky as I."
H	Then up he got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother"s house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.
Sa	He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread.
Sa	Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife: "What is to become of us?
Sa	How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?"
Sa	"But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same," said the man.
Sa	Gretel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel: "Now all is over with us."
Sa	Gretel began to cry and said: "How are we to get out of the forest now?"
H	The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone.
Sa	The man"s heart was heavy, and he thought: "It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children."
Su	And when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar.
F	Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands.
H	Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven.
F	Scream as he might, it would not help him.
Sa	"Dear God, do help us," she cried.
Sa	"If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together."
Su	Then Gretel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt.
H	How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other!
H	Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father"s neck.
H	Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness.
F	Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: "Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three."
F	The king, however, would not give his consent, and said: "It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others, and you would never come out again."
F	The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: "Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!"
Sa	Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court.
F	"Nothing nothing," he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it.
F	You can imagine how terrified the poor boy was!
F	The king gathered together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty army.
H	When the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and wished him joy of his victory.
H	The maiden laughed, and said: "He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his golden hair that he was no gardener"s boy," and then she went and kissed him.
H	His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear son again.
