Hi team,The troubleshooting steps doesn&#39;t work, on pressing power & volume down button tab gets shut down, boot options are not shown.This is my really bad online shopping experiance. From the past 1 month I am dealing with this problem and from your side after telling the troubleshooting steps which never work, request gets closed.If flipkart can&#39;t replace the product due to unavailability, then it should compensate for the faulty product. I am also helpless that I can&#39;t return the device without resetting it and I am not getting time to approach Acer service center for the same.Naveen Singla9463954807

Hi; I am Neha and regularly buy products from Flipkart.It has been a very disappointing experience to buy the Gucci Envy Meperfume from you.I have used this perfume earlier on several occasions and the fragrance haslasted a long time; but the one that I have been delivered from Flipkart isevidently duplicate.The fragrance barely lasts 2 hours and its very sad that such practices arebeing adopted by you.This is plain cheating and I request a genuine replacement or refund ofthis fraudently delivered duplicate Gucci Envy me.Kindly solve my grievances at the earliest.Regards;Neha9810174253On 26 Dec 2014 14:50, 
*MOST URGENT*From,Mr. Jitesh J. Dhule,C/o Nitin GawadeSaidatta, Sant  Dnyaneshwar Colony, Shastri Nagar,Kothrud, PunePin â 411038Date â 15th February, 2015To,The Care Manager,Flipkart Internet Private Limited,Ozone Manay Tech Park,#56/18 & 55/09, 7th Floor,Garvebhavipalya, Hosur Road,Bangalore - 560068,Karnataka, India.*Sub :-  *Failure of in my Samsung SIII Neo handset, Pebble Blue Mobile âIMI â 352607062625849*              A request to replace the handset at your cost.*Sir/Madam,            I had ordered the new Samsung SIII Neo handset as cited aboveyour website on dt. 02/02/2015. I received said mobile on 05/02/2015.Ireally grateful for your quick service.  The said handset shows problemslike getting warm intermittently, Failure of Camera etc. from the date ofreceived. I thereafter called to your customer center and filed returnrequest on 13/02/2015. They informed me that your technical team willcontact me on14/02/2015 at 4.00 pm. But they had not contacted to me andsend massage regarding apologies and said about contacting on 15/02/2015 at2.30 pm. But again same story repeated for next day.            From the first day of purchasing I am facing difficulty with myhandset. I humbly requested you to replace the same handset as early aspossible. I hereby request your good self to kindly look into the matterand give me a justice. The fact is that when a customer spends the money tothe tune of Rs. 12,499/- he does expect that the said commodity would workat least for a reasonable period. In my case the said handset is notworking from date of purchasing and therefore it is purely a manufacturingfault or that the company is not at all bothered for its customers forreplacement.            The above facts do contradict the general experience of theFlipkart Customers and do spoil the company image. It is therefore onceagain requested that, it is my right to get my mobile replaced with a newone. I look forward to getting a prompt and favorable action from your goodself; otherwise I shall be compelled to take a legal recourse through theConsumer Court, please note.            Thanking you in anticipation,Yours Faithfully,Jitesh J. Dhule-- Thanks & Regards,Mr. Jitesh Jagannath Dhule,Mob. No. 9422162334.

Hey guys don't you have sense. How many times do I have to tell you??? I order for Loreal Paris Volume Million Lashes with Offer 9.2 ml for which L'Oreal Kajal has to be provided. Initally when contacted the team they told to return the product and will deliver a new one with the freebie. But again when I opened the box there is no L'oreal kajal which is a freebie for this product.Don't you guys have sense while sending the item. Do you think customer is a fool? Do you wish me to take this issue to court for wasting my precious time and irresponsible customer care.  I won't be available at 962936346.Kindly contact me at alternative number 8220404006.

Hi Sachin,This is regarding the recent "not so expected' experience I had withFlipkart from the last day even after being entitled as a *"Flipkart FirstCustomer".* I had placed three orders on Friday and Saturday on account ofthe sale from 13th-15th February 2015. The experiences encountered arementioned as follows -:1) *Incident -:* I had bought a pair of Adidas shoes costing after discountRs.2556 having order id  *OD002068499630065000 *on *13th Feb'15* for whichthe delivery was scheduled on *15th Feb'15* as a part of  "*IN A DAYDELIVERY*". On this Sunday, when I asked the customer care regarding thedelay in delivery, after numerous excuses they said that we cannot deliverthe product since there is a mismatch in pincode for the address mentionedby you and we have no other option to satisfy you other than cancelling it.On the contrary, when I asked them as to why they didn't inform bythemselves about it, they said it is not in our rules. According to them,e-Kart logistics has rules that it cannot deliver products assigned to someother hub.*My Thoughts* *-:* If a customer has no problem in receiving it the nextday and if delivery can be done easily *since the product is in Bangaloreonly, then why cancel it!!!!! Even the product had reached the ITPL_Hubwhich belongs to 560066 pincode, then why didn't they inform me or asked meto collect it before it was sent to Kengari Mother Hub.*2) *Incident -: *On 14th Feb'15, I had bought a Levi's belt having order ID*OD102079569721074800*â which was delivered on 15th Feb'15 only to theaddress *having pincode 560037*. Although the product was mismatching withmy size, so I had placed a request for refund and it was accepted withoutany hesitation.3) *Incident -: *On 15th Feb'15, I had bought a Titan Raga Watch havingorder ID*OD20208331009458670â0 *which was also scheduled to be delivered on 16thFeb'15* like the second one having address same as it and pincode 560037*.Today when I contacted the customer care as to why the tracking status isstill being shown as ''*Expected at mother hub KNG'',* I got the similarreply as the first incident had i.e. there was a pincode mismatch, so wecannot deliver it. For your information, the product has not been deliveredto me till now as your CS said that we've changed your pincode and deliverto you today for sure.*My Thoughts -: If my second consignment was delivered at the same addressgiven in this order, then why are they saying that there pincode mismatchwhen we tried the delivery for your product!!! *I mean simply withoutasking the customer and verifying the delivery address, how can you cancelthe delivery???? If my company's address says the same pincode, who hasgiven you the authority to negate it and do whatever you want. Is thecustomer a fool who is prepaying you and getting a response like this fromyour customer support!!!! I mean is a customer a priority or not?? When acustomer is paying you Rs.400 to be a Flipkart First customer, isn't ityour duty to serve him. *Being India's biggest online retailer, is this theimpression you are throwing on the customer!!!! *I am deeply saddened by these incidents that have taken place and wish notto encounter them in future. I hope that some effective actions will betaken in this regard and a fruitful reply would be given to me in response.Regards,*Akshun Ojha*Bangalore

Just to confirm, I've been told that my order for the laptop and screen guard will be picked up for return.  Firstly, I dont have the original packaging of the screen guard and the outer package has been torn up. So I'm not sure if it would be accepted for return by the individual.  I then received a call from an ekart executive telling me he is on his way to do the pick up of the items. I told him I have some data on the laptop I need to move first. He told me to inform you guys otherwise no one will come to pick it up the next day. So this is me informing you guys. If anything, you have my phone number to reach me. Feel free to call for any clarifications.

Hi, I ordered a Nokia Lumia 530 (Order Id: OD302053545933255200) from Flipkart and the product was delivered to me on 14/2/2015. The product that I received was a damaged product. The phone is broken on the bottom side. The seal of the package was tampered and open. Even the battery had no seal and it also seems to be a duplicate one. So, please refund me my money back.  I had a conversation with one of your representatives named "Divya" and she asked me to mail my bank account details as your system was working faulty when IFSC code was provided. Even I too tried it and found it to be faulty. So, the bank account details are as follows:  Name: SUSMITA HAZRA Bank: INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Account No: 357901000000361 IFSCCode: IOBA0003579 Branch: Kestopur, Kolkata, WestBengal.  As neither me nor your representative is able to raise a return request from your system so please arrange a return for this damaged product(Order Id: OD302053545933255200) and refund the amount of Rs.5250 in the above mentioned bank account as soon as possible.  Mobile No. used at the time of order is: 9831470404 and please send details about pick up and refund in this mobile number.  I wanted to gift this mobile to my mother and the product turned out to be a damaged one. Never expected such harassment from Flipkart. Please arrange a return for the product and refund me the money at the earliest.  Regards, Soumadipta Hazra Mob: 9831470404

Dear Team,  I am writing to you with regards to the product (moto g2) which was delivered to me 10days back. The phone received by me isn't working properly (lagging a lot & speakers are not working properly when volume is high). I tried placing my request for the replacement of the product when I was told to follow few trouble shooting steps.  Post following the steps I couldn't see much difference with the performance of Moto g2.  I kindly request you to get the product replaced with the new one as I am highly unsatisfied with the performance of the product.  It would be appreciable if you can deliver the new product & arrange for a pick up at the same address i.e. (117 / 487 pandu nagar, kanpur - 208005) as I am in kanpur for my family function.  The other option is to deliver the new product at the same address where my moto G2 was delivered addressing it to Ms. Stuti Sahu  ( Stuti Sahu, Adfactors PR, City Hall, Oasis complex compound, Kamala Mills compound, Pandurang Budhkar Marg, lower Parel west, Mumbai -400013) as I will not be available till February 24. At the same time you can also send your executive to collect the old product from the address mentioned i.e. (117/487 pandu nagar, kanpur-208005).  Kindly request you to get the replacement of the product done soon because its been really long since I am chasing flipkart executives but still have not received any satisfactory action from your end.  Kindly request you to check my account (mobile - 9619060561) for any further details or let me know for any assistance.  Regards Rohit Agnihotri 9619060561

Hello,Myself Dr. S.A.Masood from New Delhi.  I am your permanent customer and frequently buyer. Few days back I have placed 3 orders of boxers of different brand. I have received one order of them.  It was cash on delivery and I paid extra 40 INR as delivery charges. The  order id: OD 102053538574948600, which I received today, when I opened this product, I was shocked because the quality of this product is worst cotton I have ever seen in my life.  In the explanation of this product was written just cotton (not written what kind of cotton). You people know better than me about quality and types of different cotton. But being aam aadmi I aslo have enough knowledge of different types of cotton like Egyptian, mercerized, Linen cotton so on... I want to return this product and get money back. Kindly pay attention on my request. Looking forward to hear from you as early as possible. Thanking you.Sincerely,Dr. S. A. MasoodMD, MPHMobile no: +91 8860115730
I would like to report to you  that my order for "For All Competitive Exams Idioms & Phrases (English) 2nd Edition"( OD301999292453975700 ) done on 5th of this month was cancelled for the third time at a stretch made with the same identical seller "WS Retail" and a  total of 100/- was refunded in my wallet for that reason for which i am grateful to flipkart,but my question is if the book is unavailable with the seller at the moment then why is it being shown available in the flipkart website.  I am really disgusted and vexed as my order was cancelled 3 times in a row after the order was confirmed with the payment method of COD.I have brought products of wide range from flipkart in recent past but i was never subjected to this type of harassment.I would just like to know whether flipkart will take any specific action against this seller or will it specifically say that the book is unavailable at the moment because both cannot coexist.IF the book is available with the seller as shown in the website then why is it not being delivered to  me for the third consecutive time.  I want some clear and fast answers about this problem and whether i will get the book in any time soon or this harassment will go on for ever.

Hi,  I am your valuable and existing customer. I have order a* Nova Titanium Blades For men NHT 1075 Trimmer* on 10th febuary. when I recieved the product i got to know by the sticker on the box it is *Nova Titanium* Blades For men *NHT 1070 *Not *Nova Titanium Blades For men NHT **1075, which i ordered.*  I called the customer care centre and inform them about the product as you gave the wrong product that cost less than what I ordered actually *NOVA 1075 *. and you charged me for that.  When I open the box i came to know actually it is not NOVA even it is a third type cheap treamer which has a nova sticker on box , so that customer will not mind about that when he will see its written nova but was the local brand which you are claiming as NOVA product as adding a sticker on someother box .  * Please open the file attachment ,look that and compare the original NOVA product box and accessories with this.*   I also want you to send me a apology letter about what you did with me ,* i will also write this mail and send all the conversation to NOVA COMPANY that what actually you are doing with their product.*  I have to give this produst to my one of relative and i gave him when he saw it was like insult and about my reputation he was blaming me that i did that ..  I will also go to consumer court and file a complaint about you .   I want claim about that , dont waste your time and my time

Dear Sir,  I'm regular customer of Flip kart. But now this time i am very disappointed ever from your service. No support from your customer executive.I purchased Lave Iris X-8 but the performance is very bad, Mobile is off automatically after sometimes. I want to flip kart to only refund my money.

Got product which has defect in backpannel & A slight manufacturing defect, But when I Complained about It to your customer service, they are saying that no one is complaining about such issue, So Is its my luck that I got a defected product?, Now they are saying go to Lenovo service Centre and show them my issue and take same in writing from them, then mail It to flipkart and then you issue me a replacement First of all If we have time then we can buy products from Retail Markets not from online Web sites, Secondly, If you are selling any product, you must take It's total responsibility, How can you tell us To go service center and all? I don't have time to do all this, If you are not accepting my return its completely fine, but I will make sure & never ever shop with you again :( Because if delivered product has any defect, you must give a replacement.

How it happened with changing the entire product and though accessories are missing with the product. I had attached the snapshots of received product and informed to your concern customer team without an delay, this is totally not good, I use to buy online from flip-kart and use to pay the transaction properly now I had received the product entirely different with missing accessories, I need immediate solution without any more delay for my product which I had ordered, look into the matter towards my need, otherwise I need to take legal step for my concern.

Dear Sir, Your person came to deliver the replacement item, and refused to hand it over because I could not give him the item that had been damaged. The item that had been damaged was a GLASS JAR IN 200 little pieces. There was no point in keeping it. *I was not told by your customer service person* at the time of reporting damaged condition to keep it to give to the delivery man. The delivery man has refused to give me the replacment Jar and has said that *I HAVE REQUESTED RETURN WHICH IS A LIE*. You have taken money for 8 items, and only given me 7. Please rectify immediately. Jehan Manekshaw On 8 February 2015 at 15:09, Flipkart Customer Support <cs

Rechargeablecells provided take 17hs to get fully charged as per the manual.Also, in the replaced camera; flash is not working.I had planned to take the camera for a small vacation; because of which Ihad opted for express shipment but thanks to WS retail and Flipkart forspoiling it.Looking forward for an early resolution.Regards ,Mukul Bawa On 12-Feb-2015 5:42 pm, 
hithis is such a worse experience with flipkart also have had good experience as well i bought two watches i intended to buy only kenneth cole but in addition bought giordano as well on account of nice image and a good price and discount so here the problem persists the color and design is entirely different as shown in the image and the real one i thought to return it on account of a wrong product but didn t return thinking it not to be expensive one yesterday i wore it for theffirst time and it was such a horrifying experience there was some activity in my office and i clapped to applaud a colleague and it fell off my wrist one of my colleague said have u bought it from ghaffar and it was really humiliating a while ago i called the customer care and spoke to sanil and another shocking thing he instead of even understanding my issue straight away said can t be done i said to transfer to senior and he denied saying he will also mention the same thing flipkart is very well known for its brand but really sorry to say it but worse customer service ever seen i bought two products on emi and want to return giordano i do not want any replacement of this product also i want to know since i bought it on emi and some interest was levied how wil this refund work i would have claimed for compensation but right now just need my entire refund for this product or else i would be forwarding a complaint to consumerccourt since am a member of it too regardsabhishek sent from my htc
For Flipkart   Hi... I purchaed a moto E phone from flipkart. After 1 month of recieveing this phone it started to automatic swich off, restart, Voice not coming during calls.. n loud speaker does not working while playing movie and and while playing Mp3. I faced very difficulty with this phone. i called to many times to flipkart but they ignored it and not replaced it. They told me go to service center finally i went to two times in delhi service center but from there they just format it and given back to me saying that it is ok. they deleted my all the data ... pics everything . My costly things msgs they deleted they i didnt said anything. now i m in chennai and i visited here services center. They told me min 3 days and max. 7 day it will take to repair it and they also told me if u will not collect the mobile after 7 days then they will charge 10 rs as a storage charge. it is also mentioned in attached bill when u can charge us for storage then we can also charge for not giving our mobile on time. i m working in a very big company, all my company work is going on through phone but as i dont have any phone i have to face so many probles my boss, client , suppliers trying to call me and they they abusing me , bcoz of non availability of phone i could not communicate on time to supplier .. due to which he got very much loss. Everytime i called ur services center they told me the parts are not available they are in transit. So it is requested to u. kindly compensate me with a min. of 10000 rupees. Niether i will go to legal action with ahigher amount.   --  Thanks,  Sazid Husain  +918098610159

From Anil Yadav 7639966465  To, Flipkart  & His service Team   i would like to deeply gratitude to all flipkart team, Customer care services and delivery services. Thanks a lot for sending me replacement Order. Thanks to flipkart team. (basically the guys who call me at 5 pm on 12 feb,He has done his job nicely.)  To WS retailer,  On the contrary i would like to express my inconvenience regrading the misplacement of the shipment delivered by WS retailer. I would also like to add that as the replacement took time to be delivered, the price of the product was reduced by Rs1500/- approx at that time. Moreover , I had to reschedule my holiday plan as i had to wait for the replacement delivery due to which i suffered alot of problem. So,i would like to ask for some rewards as the replacement cost me a loss of Rs 1500/-.  Yours faithfully Anil Yadav

Hello, This was the first time I ordered from Flipkart & it has been a terrible experience all thanks to bluedart courier service. My waybill no - 59390614555 & reference - S 82456835. The courier guy parked his van 1km away from my house & told me to collect the parcel. I told him this was highly Impossible for me. I also told him that just this morning a FedEx guy delivered a courier at my doorstep so why can&#39;t he do that ? He was so incompetent that he couldn&#39;t make any head or tail about my address. I tried to give him directions which again he failed to follow. Suddenly he cut the call. I wasted my entire day waiting for my parcel & after a few hours when I checked online, the status for my parcel was &quot; Consigned not available&quot;. How unethical & shameful is that ! I want you not just deliver my parcel at my doorstep but also to take action against this lazy lying courier guy who must hv duped many more like me. Hope you will act similarly. Thank you for your valuable time

Hello Team Flipkart.  Let me thank you for encouraging me to not buy from flipkart and switch to amazon.in (You are million miles behind comparing to your customer service).  I have order no-OD302067497824016100 which was placed on Feb-13 assuming it will get delivered to me on Feb-17 (as mentioned on portal), till date I haven't received my consignment and I have spoken to flipkart customer service team but only have been told to wait (I have made 5 calls to be precise).  You people lack service being end customer I have to beg for customer and from sellers end I haven't received any calls since yesterday and still awaiting it. Where as amazon.in shares delivery person's no so that you can call him and get update.  Please learn from them.  I am waiting for consignment and thanks for overall horrible experience,team.  I blame myself for shopping with flipkart.  Kamlesh   Sent from BlackBerryÂ® on Airtel

Dear Flipkart Customer Care,      I had ordered Giordano  Wrist Watch for Ladies, however you delivered gents watch . After receiving the same I have to hear from your customer care executive that ladies watch is not in your stock. Because of no stock of the item ordered, you are resorting to send wrong item , this is extremely frustrating and results in waste of time for the customers. It is extremely unfortunate that being a regular customer of Flipkart we are made to suffer because of wrong delivered item from your end. Please ensure to send the correct item as per the order.      Kindly find attached the declaration form for refund of Rs. 2835/- immediately in my account , also attached driving license as identity proof. Kindly take the delivery of the item and process the refund at the earliest .     Thank you-   Karunamoy Agnihotri  Mobile: 0990992647
Please make Cash on Delivery (COD) at 193502 (pincode of Bandipora district of Jammu & Kashmir). There are so many people (including ne as well) who want to place order on Flipkart, but because of unavailability of COD at this location they opt out and are disappointed. Please this is a humble request to make COD available at 193502 so we also can enjoy the online shopping experience.
my another no is if u have any doubts call to this no ad the order is genuine
Hi, Flipkart has not just caused an inconvenience but added tremendous pain pushing me to Samsung Service centers across Delhi for rectification of the products (as an Engineer, I have communicated in the first instance that the products are fake, but so Flipkart does not have the ETHICAL STRENGH to accept the mistake). As a good customer of Flipkart over the years, I followed your instructions and visited many centers of Samsung but they did not accept the product even for testing since it does not belong to them (they are correct indeed) I had to raise this matter to Samsung in writing and with a written response; had got a chance to test the product at Samsung service center and was declared that its not their product which means its a fake Samsung product. (PLEASE SEE ATTACHED COMMUNICATION from Samsung). I have given ample time to replace the product with a real Samsung make (as I bought this product based on your certification on the website that you sell Genuine products). You have given me tremendous pain over telephonic discussions, written responses; but never demonstrated an ethical behavior owning up your act of error that could have settled the issue. Now, am unable to reconcile with my self from the feeling of being cheated from one of my most trusted brands. Let me now explore all possible options including resorting to legal remedies for cheating and mis-guiding the customer in a fraudulent manner, even after communicating the problem with the supplied product that happened to be fake. Might make Samsung also a party and would request them to initiate suitable action Sreenivasa Reddy
Dear sir,  I had purchased two jeans (west 46) on 07/02/2015. It was delivered on 11/02/2015. I had checked but west is two high so I want to replace. I had called yesterday on your customer care no. They are telling now stock is empty after that when i chacked online it is showing in stock. It is very frustrating thing. I was thought that flip cart is very safest site(so far good experience also) for online purchasing thats why I preferred flip cart only (you can check history how much I had ordered) but I was wrong you all are the same. Now after this I will not buying anything thank you for your service so far...

Hi Team,  This is a B2C related query, and corporate sales will not be able to assist the customer. Please look in to below customer query and respond at email given below:  Customer Email Id: sudhir.nadar9@gmail.com Email Description: Hi, You guys are quite smart in not having any contact with the customers after a sale is done. In fact you dont leave any medium for us to talk to you. I just got delivered a vans shoe today on 17th feb, and I found it to be of bad fit. So I went to my flipkart account and I couldnt complete it as 2-3 options like bank name, bank city were not working, I dont understand this shit. Everything was working except these two. Now Im going to take you to consumer court If you dont get this product back and have my money back. So what I need u guys to do is to help me out or else be prepared to be served with notice. I hope u will understand. sudhir.nadar9@gmail.com   Regards, Corporate Sales Team

Dear Mr. Sachin,  Hope you know how your representative Ms.Bharthi talks to customer and how rude she is on calls.  I'm writing this email with dissatisfaction with regards to MI4 which I placed an order.  Got this phone to gift this phone to my brother in law unfortunately my sister gifted one plus one to him and this phone is waste now.  I told your representative that we got this to gift my bother in law but since he already got another phone this phone is a waste and I can't use it, even I told I can't resell on olx and explained consequences.  She was lest bothered to listen it was like some one had forced to talk to me,she doesn't know customer service skills.  With regards to the phone it's still in the box like the way you guys delivered it and have not even removed it out.  If you guys can't take it back I know how and whom to approach.  I hope Hugo Bara and MI team looks into the matter on flipkart talks to their customers who own mi products.  Regards, Disappointed dissatisfied customer  SHUAIB

Hi, The issue is I am not the correct person to be called. I am getting some other customer's emails to my mailbox from Flipkart.This account seems to be recently created on Feb14 when I got an email of account creation. I did not create this account, then why are these emails coming to me ? Looks like the actual person by name Divya Goyal with contact number 8007424772 (I noticed this name and number from the orders placed by her) has created an account with flipkart with an incorrect email id or using my email id. I don't even know her in the first place. So wanted to request you to approach her and get it corrected. Hope this helps ? I am getting mails which are not even meant for me. Regards, Divya

It was not my intention to write back, but after doing what you have told, still touch screen is not working properly sometimes. Thinking that it is a software problem, I've updated some apps, and also tried rebooting, wiping cache, and factory reset as you have asked to do so, not once, but many times now. I'm losing my patience now. If it was a software issue, wouldn't it have been solved when factory reset is done. The screen goes numb few minutes, then I have to wait for it to work again. I hope you people will help resolve this issue because I have had enough. I've lost a data balance every time I do a reset and reinstall apps like WhatsApp and Facebook.

Hi, I ordered a Nokia Lumia 530 (Order Id: OD302053545933255200) from Flipkart and the product was delivered to me today. The product that I received was a damaged product. The phone is broken on the bottom side. The seal of the package was tampered and open. Even the battery had no seal and it also seems to be a duplicate one. So, please refund me my money back.  I had a conversation with one of your representatives named "Divya" and she asked me to mail my bank account details as your system was working faulty when IFSC code was provided. Even I too tried it and found it to be faulty. So, the bank account details are as follows:  Name: SUSMITA HAZRA Bank: INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Account No: 357901000000361 IFSC Code: IOBA0003579 Branch: Kestopur, Kolkata, WestBengal.  As neither me nor your representative is able to raise a return request from your system so please arrange a return for this damaged product(Order Id: OD302053545933255200) and refund the amount of Rs.5250 in the above mentioned bank account as soon as possible.  Mobile No. used at the time of order is: 9831470404 and please send details about pick up and refund in this mobile number.  I wanted to gift this mobile to my mother and the product turned out to be a damaged one. Never expected such harassment from Flipkart. Please arrange a return for the product and refund me the money at the earliest.  Regards, Soumadipta Hazra Alternate mail Id: sh_0589@yahoo.co.in Mob: 9831470404

Hello,You said the item will be delivered by Feb 18th.Â When I checked the status, it shows the order cancelled; so I called the customer care and was told its cancelled due to courier issues.WHAT THE FUCK is this? Â This is absolutely shit service you are providing.A new requestÂ #OD101984239295338300Â is created for the exchange.I had placed the original request on Feb 2 and I have still not got the correct product.Â Do whatever you want to but I want this product delivered by this SUNDAY.Â Jaimin     
Hi Team.The product is "not as described" thats why I have to select damagedproduct as a reason.The product is described as "Samsung" brand and of "aluminium" with"Silver" color. However product delivered to me is not of samsung, its aplastic material not at all sturdy.... and also the color is also notsilver ... its silver + golden.the image shown on the portal is misleading and wrong product has beenshipped.Please initiate refund. i do not want this case. I have created an onlinereturn application as well.Thank
Flipkart i am very angry from you -_-  Your service is getting worst day by day  I have ordered the Redmi Note 4g for my friend from my account 1-2 days back  He got a damaged box -_-  What the hell are you doing  I said him that i will ask replacement for you but he denied that he will not take full replacement -_-  I don't know how pathetic service flipkart is doing now a days  You are delivering phones that too with torn up boxes -_-  I want solution on this flipkart!  he had to gift it to his sister on his birthday that's today -_- he gifted it without the box only -_- just think at it once. Now he can't even ask for replacement of the product due to this reason and he is blaming me that i ordered the phone for him.  Now please solve this problem 
Hi,I had placed one day delivery order for theÂ RemingtonS2002 Hair Straightner. It was delivered on the same day. Thank you for that.I had placed this order as a Valentines day gift. The product you delivered however is a CLEAR DUPLICATE and looks USED.My friend has the same product and I have compared that to the product I received, and it confirms that the product is a CLEAR DUPLICATE.Since I gifted the CLEAR DUPLICATE product it makes me look bad and Flipkart even worse.I have had great business with Flipkart earlier but this service is much beyond disappointing.I have attached the pictures of the product delivered. Please see for yourself and let me know why you intend to sell duplicate product to your loyal customers.TheÂ RemingtonS2002 Hair Straightener cover box also looks torn and used/old.If I wanted a duplicate/used product I could have gone for OLX or quickr as the sources.This is very disappointing from your end.Since 7PM 13th Feb,2015 I have been trying to return the product and get the refund.But there seems to be a technical issue in your end due to which the order details have not been updated and the return/refund is not being possible.I have called your Â customer support team several times.I would have gone for a replacement but by the look of things I have lost trust in your service/seller. Also I wanted the product today and hence paid the extra amount for the one day delivery.But replacement would not give me the product today as it seems.Please have my order refunded/returned at the earliest.If by a miracle you can provide a NEW and ORIGINAL product today, please call me on my number mentioned below or email me.Regards,Very disapointed customer, Dipankar991644799

I have bought a camera Nikon D3300 DSLR camera, but the product delivered was not genuine, hardware specification is not same as it is mentioned in flipkart. I have requested for the replacement with good camera, which flipkart has refused mentioning it out of stock, but agreed for refund. Flipkart guy has come to collect the camera, and he is ready to take the camera without noting my account details. On asking Flipkart's customer care executive 'On Which account the refund amount will get credited?' he is not clear, first he mentioned your e-wallet, then he mentioned credit card you have used to buy it. For your information the camera is 0f Rs. 26000+, and I am not going to buy any stuff from flipkart surely after this incident, so e-wallet is not an option. Credit card used was not mine so again its not the option. I requested to note down my account details which he refused mentioning system is down. Due to uncertainity of refund, I have not given the camera to the Flipkart guy.  **Kindly resolve this issue asap.**  FYI, I have bought the camera about 20 days ago. I couldn't use it because I have to replace it. I have called more than 5 times spent almost 100 Rs in call. It is costing me about Rs.3000, if I order it now. Also my Rs.26000+ is with you for about a month for no reason.  Still you are expecting me to call again and again for the refund.  Regards, Bhushan

Hi  Flipkart Team.    I would say this is really a frustrating experience which I've experienced over here. I strongly feel that I should have purchased from the market.    Every time I end up my call by getting a commitment  that Refund would get initiated if the Pick up would not get done the same day.    Don't you thin k that you guys are harassing your customers when he has purchased a high value product & is suffering since last 20 days and every time getting false commitment.    Shame on you guys!!      With Thanks and Best Regards,  Manoj bhardwaj 9312051986
in how much time i will get the refund of jeans sent from my iphone
Hi This is in regard with my order for Moto G 2nd Generation that I had ordered. When I got the phone for the first time, it had some battery issues so I got it replaced and the phone that I returned I had applied a screen guard on its screen,as I returned it with the screen guard my screen guard got wasted that I had bought from outside. Now with the replacement phone that I have got,it's again a defective one,I have again raised a replacement request for the same and on this phone too I have applied the screen guard so again if I return this then my 2nd screen guard will get wasted for a single phone that I will return for a 3rd replacement of the phone. So,for the compensation I want flipkart to send me a screen guard for my phone because this phone does not come with one.Flipkart gave me a defective phone twice so I would expect you to do the needful now.

Team â I had ordered this headphone but found that volume buttons are not working. It seems like this head phone does not work on Moto G, but works on other phones.This information was not provided in the production description. I have applied for the order return, But on the website there is no option to select refund. I don't need a replacement but I need a refund. Order Number: OD002032698363432700Return ID: 14320535RegardsAbhijith
