The outer packaging by flipkart was having a small hole(nevermind)  The inner packaging was completely ripped off with full of dust & mud, with no seal or anything.  The trackpant was having all logos stickers tags etc, but it doesn't seems to be a new piece, this piece is quite dull.  Now you only suggest that what am i supposed to do next?  Regards

Hi, I ordered for a JBL micro wireless white and gray speaker and received it yesterday. The piece I received is completely white and have a black speaker grill while the one displayed on flipkart website while shopping has gray bezels(sides) and also speaker grill was gray... Now I am not sure if you guys have sent me the correct product or not. I am so disappointed with such ambiguity.  Also as I further inspected, on the box itself its written on back side "what's in the box" and it mentions (1 carrying case) which I didn't find in the box or package. Now this is disgustingly annoying. I don't know if the product was opened before by seller or if it is a used product. But this is unfair and trust me I am going to take this legal if you guys didn't do anything about it. Previously you guys sent me a damaged product which I returned and now accessory is missing. What the hell has happened to flipkart standards, why there is no quality check. If I call customer care and you guys start yelling out the policies. I paid for a product and that box must include everything it mentioned on the box. I don't know who Is at fault. Sent me a wrong color speaker and also carrying case is missing. I want this to be resolved as quickly as possible, or consequences will be severe.  I have attached pictures of product and the box where you can check what I am talking about.

Hello.My order no is OD202014711714100301The moment I poured oil, it started leaking and the glass part was broken. I don't hav the original packaging because it was fine when I poured the oil into it. And I jst threw the packaging. An hr later it started leaking and suddenly I realized glass part was already broken. U must start doing quality check before dispatching which I'm sure was not done.I need the replacement or any other oil dispenser at the same cost. Since I'm a regular customer to flipkart and to avoid negative feedback from my end you have to understand my problem of not having original packing. Because defect was seen after an hr, and no one will keep the packing if it's fine initially.Thanks and regards.Fariha Khan. My flipkart email is shaoork2k@yahoo.com

Hello,I have received a wrong item again. This is not the first time I amreceiving a wrong product. For the same order last time also I got a wrongproduct and raised a replacement. I got refund. When raising last ticketitself I told that the time is getting wasted. Now it's been more than 10days and I have got wrong product.I have attached the product I ordered and the item I received. This isreally a great disappointed from flipkart. I have started getting irritateddue to wrong product and they delay in delivery by the third party supplier.I haven't seen such an irresponsible behaviour from flipkart before. And ifit continues again I am sure it will lose its customer Base day by day.I raised a support ticket already and I haven't got the response yet. Iwant to remind flipkart that I have paid my flipkart subscription and inpaper it was mentioned as priority service and feel privileged.Thanks,BalajiOn 16 Feb 2015 23:08,

HiÂ On 12 Feb 2015 I had order Murcia Hand Held Bag from your website with a gift wrap. The product which I have chosen on your website and the one which I received is entirely different, I mean its like the world of difference between two. Adding to this frustration was your packaging which was also without a gift wrap.Â I am feeling ashamed to receive this low quality product as this was the valentine gift for my fiance Ms. Rabab Fatima.Attached is the picture of the original item I have order from the website and snapshot of the one I have actually received. Kindly get this item returned and deliver the item which I have originally order & with the gift wrap. ASAPÂ Regards- Honey Raz

Now here is the thing, On 13th Feb I got a message(PFA) in my phone that my request is been proceeded and your tech team will call me. They called me on took the information about the phone. Then on 14th I got a message(PFA) that this person with this name will come and take my moto g2 package for replacement. But here is the this no one came to receive it, than In evening I got a message that sorry we were unable to pick it up, will collect the order tomorrow which is 15 Feb. Again on 15th Feb(PFA) I was waiting but nobody came to pick it up.  I mean what the hell is happening with your support team. And today when I called first time a boy told me that the problem was in me. I didn't confirm. I confirm it twice with your tech support that Sim is not working and you guys send me messages with concern person number and timing and you are telling I dint mistake.  Today is the last day of my 30 days replacement period but my package is not collect although i had asked to do it 5 days before.  I want a immediate action for this. I want my moto g2 to be replaced with the working phone.  Please do take some serious action otherwise I very well know what necessary steps should be taken.  If you guys are projecting you are best in the market then you must show that too

Hi, I installed flipkart app last night and it showed the offer of getting extra 200 off on your first order above 999 using app.  I selected 2 shoes and in the final payment page it showed the discount. But in my bank page it didn't show so i cancelled the transaction. Now I can no longer see the 200 rs discount. I want to place the order ASAP so please look into the matter and bring back that discount so i can place the order.  Thanks Rishabh 8860036269

Hi,     I presented this gift to someone because of valentine's day. But to my shock, the product is not up to the mark and is really embarrassing for me. This is second time, I had to return your product. Day by day, I am loosing faith on flipcart.   Still I have registered  myself for Lenovo A6000. I do not know, whether I get the product or not or even I get, what would be quality of the product.        Not happy this time.     Debotosh Roy  9958292947

I am very disappointed with your service. I am a daily customer of Flipkart and I even refer Flipkart to others for online shopping. But this time, your service was worse. I purchased an Asus Modem but the range of the modem was not at all good and it was not what I wanted. I'll buy another one later but before that, I want to return it. I want my refund to be processed as soon as possible. I didn't face any such a problem before but this time I unhappy with your service. I'll be obliged if you process my refund and pick up the modem. Thank You   On Wed, Feb 18, 2015 at 12:09 PM, apurva tilwani <tilwaniapurva@gmail.com> wrote:  > i want my refund > > >

An early action in this matter will be highly appreciated.     Thanks again                                    Sincerely yours                                    Kamal K.

my order no OD202110365258818800  placed on 18th feb 2015 was cancelled by flipkart after shipment, after contacting the customer care, I was informed that my order was cancelled due to high demand, but what I want to know is that why did flipkart confirm and ship my order if they didn't have proper amount of units available with them, I deem this action highly unprofessional and demand answers as to why my order was cancelled.

Dear CS Team, Even after all that had happened recently, you people did not learn any lesson and had deliberately cancelled my order. And your CS executive Paurush, after putting the call on hold for 9 min tld me that delivery was attempted on 17th and thereafter it was cancelled. Then how come delivery was attempted on 17th itself The tracking clearly states that item was shipped from Bilaspur on 16th and was su[ppose to reach at Rangpuri Hub on 18th This is nothing less then your cheap tactics to harass customer who had been very vocal and taken serious not of your arrogance in talking disrespectfully to a lady.taking the call I am not giving up this I'm going to ply the entire recording before your MD at A-25 Sarita Vihar New Delhi SHAME on you! Its very rightly said "Good wombs deliver good babies"
Sir,Â Â  For your negligence, I being compelled and brought yesterday a Samsung mobile from the open market with high cost and less satisfaction. For violation of consumer protection act intentionally, if you are giving any token of apology amount, that must be 10 % of the order amount for the ends of justice. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For your kind information, you have already paid to other customers 10% of the order amount as compensation for the non delivery of the same product I.e. Lenovo A6000. I can also submit you his mail id. ( gobinda_bls@yahoo.co.in).Â  Discrimination between customers can not be permitted. Yours sincerelyBibhu Prasanna MohapatraAdvocate

?Dear Best e-commerce with worst services,?    2 consecutive orders placed via flipkart have turned out tobe flops. Both items were defective.  There will be a known statement from you all"Its sellers who sell the products" Then I think you all shouldquality check the sellers who are selling the products under your brand name. Bothproducts were ordered for gifting purpose and both got to me nothing but uttershame just because of you all. PATHETIC and such a situation is not at all inanyway portrays your customer centricity and doing the right thing for yourcustomers.  Please refer to the attached images, where it shows thatthere was no proper packaging and it was not cushioned. It might have been thatthe seller would have thought that itâs already damaged and letâs send it offâ¦This is ridiculous. And if you see the order, it was paid for gift wrapping, sodoes that not make any ring in the packaging teamsâ head that the productsshould be quality-checked?? Anyways all products you dispatch should be qualitychecked so that it saves the time and such compromising situations in socialgatherings for customers because all are paying for it, it not given for  DAMN free. Amazon is far better in ways of packaging and takes UTMOSTcare for the ordered products and ensures seller quality. They are not careless like Flipkart. Its not a good idea at all to be complacent for any reason to hamper customer experience at the cost of your customer's money and reputation. I am surely going to deactivate and close myaccount with you all and cascade such acts of carelessness and zero quality managementand assurance for items paid with money by the customers and giving them such humiliationback. Pathetic and Frustrating.  One of your Most dissatisfied customer, (How do you all care, you have so many to handle) Manojit Banerjee. Ph: 0934365547

Dear Sir/Ma'am. It's very unfortunate to express my disappointment for the product i have been waiting to receive from you since Feb 2 has reached me in well sealed pack but has some accessories missing.  While I had to replace my order (ASUS ZENFONE 501 CG) due to specification error and now that i have received new phone sent by you to me via BLUE DART. The parcel reached me in a sealed/good condition, but when i opened the phone pack, it disappointed me once again as the phone box doesn't contain earphone and the USB lead. It had phone, warranty card, manual and just the charger/adopter but the charging/data lead (USB) and the earphones are missing from the package. The package content pictures are attached here. I'm now complaining for the missing items and hope an immediate response from your end. Also the battery problem remains the same as the phone is consuming battery very fast and the rear side of the phone does really get heat-up while charging as well as during use.  Kindly make an early redressal of my complaint  THANKS    --      *With regards,Shah Aijaz  (Journalist)Srinagar Kashmir+91-9419008794; +91-8803389489.....

Hi,  I had ordered Samsung Car Adapter and Travel Adapter on 1st Feb'15. However, I received the product with broken seal. Further the manufacturing date on product does not match with the manufacturing date mentioned on product packaging. I had complained about the same to Flipkart customer support over call and they processed product replacement with assurance that I would get brand new genuine product with proper sealed package.  On 15th Feb'15 I received the replacement product which I opened before the delivery person to make sure its genuine but to my surprise the replacement product too had the seal broken with mismatch in manufacturing date as before. I asked the delivery person to take back the same but he told me to contact you for further support.  After all this headache I am going through I have started believing that Flipkart does not have any mechanism to check whether the customer receives properly sealed genuine product or not. I had been a loyal customer of Flipkart since beginning but after this incident I have to rethink before ordering anything in future as counterfeit products with broken seal are being shipped now. I am not sure how you are going to build that trust again but this has surely hurt my confidence of buying the products online.  Now, I sincerely request you to either ship genuine sealed product to me as replacement or if you are unable to do so request you to please refund my money back.  Thanks for your continued support.  Regards, Amol Kharche + 91 9552655099

Hi, My registered mobile no. is 8105966866. The above mentioned order should have ideally been delivered on 13/02/2015. I had to call the customer services on not hearing from you people till end of business. The service on the call was awful. I obviously asked a compensation be paid out for the delay. The executive said I will get a call within the next 24 hours and the order will be delivered at 9am on 16/02/2015. I did not receive any call the whole of Saturday. When I received the call on Sunday I was in the church. I tried returning the call later but to no avail.

I have bought a camera Nikon D3300 DSLR camera, but the product delivered was not genuine, hardware specification is not same as it is mentioned in flipkart. I have requested for the replacement with good camera, which flipkart has refused mentioning it out of stock, but agreed for refund. Flipkart guy has come to collect the camera, and he is ready to take the camera without noting my account details. On asking Flipkart's customer care executive 'On Which account the refund amount will get credited?' he is not clear, first he mentioned your e-wallet, then he mentioned credit card you have used to buy it. For your information the camera is 0f Rs. 26000+, and I am not going to buy any stuff from flipkart surely after this incident, so e-wallet is not an option. Credit card used was not mine so again its not the option. I requested to note down my account details which he refused mentioning system is down. Due to uncertainity of refund, I have not given the camera to the Flipkart guy.  *Kindly resolve this issue asap.*  FYI, I have bought the camera about 20 days ago. I couldn't use it because I have to replace it. I have called more than 5 times spent almost 100 Rs in call. It is costing me about Rs.3000, if I order it now. Also  my Rs.26000+ is with you for about a month for no reason.  Still you are expecting me to call again and again for the refund.  Regards, Bhushan

This is to inform you that I have received an incorrect item. Instead of Samsung Galaxy Note 4, I received blackberry Q5.  This was a gift for my brother. I have ordered for samsung galaxy note 4 on 11 feb night with a 1 day delivery and i was supposed to get the product on 13 feb.I planned to give him as a surprise on 13 night when the clock ticks 12 of 14 feb. But due to your late delivery i couldnt and gave it to my brother on 14 feb but when he opened the box in front of us there was no phone in that i felt so humiliated. I told the same to your customer care guys and i was arranged for a replacement which i was to get delivered on 16 feb by giving back the box and items of my first delivery. But  i did not get it easy way either the delivery guy refused to give me the item because according to their papers i was supposed to give him the phone along with the accessories that i got in my first delivery, but that was my concern that i didnt get a phone so was getting a replacement . So i called up your cs again and was told to meet the delivery guy and give the phone to him and they will talk with him and help me with the delivery. I did not go to office on that day for the delivery but i couldnt get it on time so went to my office to just login there and came back by 8. i called up the delivery guy he asked me to come to the facility hub or will deliver next day since it was festival for me the next day i went to their office but got it with very great difficulty because the guys there want to have a confirmation mail from your end so finally after talking to your cs for more than an hour they send a mail and i got the delivery. The supervisor in the hub facility asked me to open and check the box since i already faced lot of problem with the product, but i like a fool told him that its okay i would make my bro open it as i am gifting him the phone. After i reached home i suddenly just want to make sure about the phone before giving him, to my surprise it was some other phone about which i have never heard of a Blackberry phone Q5, i thought the box is wrong but the pack is completely sealed and brand new so i didnt open it and immediately called the cs, First you guys sent an empty box and now some other phone . This is not acceptable.   I told the CS guy that whoever will call me regarding this, call me on 18th as 17th is festival and I'll be busy. But i guess you people called me yesterday itself i was not with my phone so couldnt answer any i checked the messages yesterday night well anyways the message says someone will call me today again i will coordinate with them.  I just want my money back, send who ever you want to collect this Q5 as soon as possible. According to my convenience i will  meet the courier guy and give him the incorrect product. where ever i am comfortable with as i cannot take off from my office for this and there is no one at my home for more than a week.  Please take back your incorrect product and refund my money. I don't trust you guys anymore. I will buy a new product right away from the shop and give the belated gift.    Huh i am done with this will never try to gift a surprise to anyone atleast by buying things online. And will never buy any phone online until and unless a day comes that the product i want to buy is only available online hope that never happens .  I hope this is my first and last order on Flipkart

The product was delivered to my given address today morning but unfortunately, after opening the sealed packet I found it to be a damaged item. I contacted your customer care department regarding this issue and was advised by them to opt for the refund policy since a replacement cannot be done at this point of time, the product being out of stock right now. I, being the buyer, am not having a single account in my name at present and as a result, I am sending this copy of the Third Party Declaration Form attached along with this mail and also the copy of PAN Card of the respective account holder. I would be grateful if you kindly look into this matter and assist me with this refund as soon as possible.  Regards, Debosmita Das

Dear Customer care team/ technical headThis is to share that I received my Xiaomo mi4 on Friday 13th Feb'2015. .my phone has heating problem and battery gets discharge very quickly.I quickly requested for a return of the piece to Flipkart on 14th Feb morning and dully specifying the reason that my phone is abnormally heated after a few moment of starting any game or starting charging or after continue some time of voice call. It is very serious issue as we cannot continue a voice call due to this heat issue. I requested to change my set at the earliest otherwise it is not possible to keep continuing use of your product due to serious damage of ears. After that call, I got an sms that said my request for return has been registered and it was under process. Some Flipkart representative soon afterwards called me and told that they will put me through to the technical support. The technical support guy told me that i have to  reset the phone and do an update. He was very casual. Well, I don't know how many people do a factory reset as soon as they buy a new phone. I got a rude shock after 7 hours. I again got sms from Flipkart that the retailer has denied my request for return. I don't know how they decided that my request was not valid.this same procedure is happening since last 3 days. i call flipkart customer care and then 7-8 hrs I receive call from technical team .. so irritating. Wasting all my time in this phone issue only.I have updated my phone and still facing the same problem. It is very dangerous to use this phone. The battery gets so much heated that you can not even put it on your ear and talk and its like that the battery can burst any time. I have been following up with Flipkart since last 3 days. this is a complete harassment to the customer. if this phone has got heating problem then you should have mentioned it on your website before selling the phone.  I have purchased lot of items through Flipkart and have never faced any problem in returning or exchanging any product. This is the first time that I am being harrassed by the customer and technical team. When you have 30 day return policy why dont you take it back and replace it if the customer is not satisfied.Now I am again putting in a request to either refund my money or replace this phone asap because I cant use this phone.Do send me all the correspondence at this email id.ThanksPoonam Arora8285010024---

Dear Sir or Madam,  I am writing this letter to express my disappointment with recent (last 3) purchases&nbsp;on&nbsp;your online store. My registered mobile number/ email id are 8652467708 / hbk_1988@rediff.com.  &nbsp;Order descriptions are as follows:-  OD102004979053916600:- 7 Rainbow Self Design Fashion Georgette Sari, My original order was for pink and white color and the one which got delivered to me is in blue color. Though itâs getting replaced but for that I need to wait for another 10 days.  &nbsp;  OD101964292978753500:- Fila Rootz Sneakers, This product was ordered on 1st feb 2015 and scheduled to delivered by 5th feb 2015 but unfortunately i donât know for which reason it was postponed to&nbsp; 12th feb 2015, but flipkart failed to dispatch with the new date as well in fact they(Flipkart) even bothered to intimate me. It wasnât over yet, when I reacted regarding same I got the message that âwe are sorry for the delay flipkart executive will help you within next 24 hoursâ, next 24 hours ends up with above message again along with rescheduled delivery date for 14 feb 2015. Hope it will get dispatched by today.  &nbsp;  OD201853912123330100:- Microsoft Lumia 535, This order was placed on 19th jan 2015 and it was first incident from where I started losing trust on flipkart, I was suppose to gift this phone to someone and assumed that this will get delivered within 2-3 days as usually flipkart do and have done in past in my case, but I end up with disappointment, yes it was my bad that I assumed that order will be delivered before the delivery date. But situation turned even worst in next two(above) order.  &nbsp;  On top of all when I connected to your executive âPriyankaâ by today 14th feb 2015 it was really disgraceful and its really heading me to think about some other online stores.&nbsp; Yes I asked her to justify that my payments towards above orders are value for money, and reply I got that if flipkart is charging for any product then they are providing that product to you, but I really didnât agree with that. If I am asking for pink and getting blue color, promised to deliver within 3-5 days but not event delivered by 14 days, can you please explain how I am getting value for money?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I hope above issues will be taken seriously unlikely my orders were.    Thanks and Regards Ajeet Singh8652467708

Hi. My name is Janam Mehta. I had purchased "Rega IT HP Compaq G42-410US 65 W Adapter" on 26th December 2014. My invoice number is "2014-15-0009834" and my Order ID is "OD301628821986980300". My adapter is not charging my laptop and so I want my adapter to be replaced with a new one. So, I want to know whether or not Flipkart would replace my adapter? I had a talk with one of the courier services. They told me that if I want to courier my adapter to the company I purchased from, it would cost Rs 350. So, I now want Flipkart to take the responsibility of replacing my adapter, because I had nothing to do with my charger's no working condition. Reply me with an answer as soon as possible.
Hi, This is in context with an order which I was trying to place on my flipkart mobile app for which I was making payment through credit card.  I followed the payments steps as indicated but on final step it gave an error "Unable to reach flipkart please try again later", though I received a mesage from my bank that amount had been deducted from my credit card account.  Please check & update about this issue. Required details of item & bank message can be found in trail mail.  Item : Miraan Cotton Printed Salwaar Suit Dupatta Material  Qty : 2  MSG from bank : "Rs 1238 was spent on your Credit Card 5546XXXXXXXX5016 on 16-Feb-15 at FLIPKART INTERNET PR"  Transaction Code : 196503  Regards, Aamir Sultan 9648477777

I would like to clear one point to you being legal professional person I know point which you violated in this case by doing forged sticker pasting on it, so also it is against the CRPC &  IPC . It is not simply product quality case as it happened with online E Commerce company but it is a case of knowing cheating and fraud.  So it's crystal clear point that you should compensate me as I asked 1500 rupees otherwise just ready for legal procedure. I only give 6 hours till Evening than  I will start my legal procedure. Now it depends on you, if you don't want to give me compensation just refused me. As I have all evidence against you and sellers.  This would me my last reminder regarding it as I don't have much time for this small issue. So please fulfill my requirement. Hope you understand the issue and its legal dimensions

Hi,  Sorry to miss your call as i am out of town and will be available over email.  Actually, I wanted to order Lava IRIS x8 by EMI payment mode. Unknowingly, i paid with the wrong option of credit card than emi.

Kindly process my order* OD302094900664481200 with Emi payment option * and cancel the order *OD202092749281135300.*  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Hope I am clear and please do the needful.  Note: I suppose they have already cancelled and processed my refund. Thanks.   Regards Pushparaj. A

Hello Today 14-2-15, around 1:30pm your delivery boy came with package and asked for return packet first and wanted to see the item in it. We showed him the item he said fine, and asked to sign for delivery We told him that last time there was just 1 nightsuit, so you check or let us check for 2 nightsuits in package He said i wont do that, you sign and take package, or i m going, We told him problem again. He said, fine i m going. And he just ran away, like last time. We keep on asking him to stop, but he didnt stop He was the same guy who came last time for delivery I told you in my first email of complaint that after taking payment he just ran away This time also, he just ran away. Is there some kind of problem with your delivery boys? I order from myntra and amazon also, they do not have such rude workforce. They never hav any problem with opening of packages, and even if i hav to return, they say it politely that, contact the customercare and ur package will be picked for return later. I wud appreciate if you arrange the delivery of 2 night suits i ordered and that too by some other delivery boy. On 7 Feb 2015 21:53, "Flipkart Customer Support" <cs

GPS feature is also not working properly.3. Heating Problem, while playing games or heavy use for 20-25 minutes.Upper back side of phone is heating so badly.I would request you to kindly replace or return this handset.

To whom it may concern,  I am writing this email to request information regarding why my order was not delivered and the lack of proper service given by one of your customer service employee.   Below are the order details:   *Order number: OD202007399139007000*  *Product: 32' LG Led TV*  *Delivery Address: *   My concern is that, as per the delivery to pin code entering space, I provided the following pin code :-362265 (Verawel). And your website shows one seller in that location. Yet after i payed for the product, after 2 weeks I get a call from courier service that the delivery is not possible to my address which was very disappointing and I also had a talk with your customer service and was promised that the delivery will be made. But the very next day delivery was canceled without any notice.Provide me with some appropriate reason for the inconvenience.    Regards, Smarth Sing

Dear Concern,     I am disappointed with the attitude shown by Flipkart to deliver my order "OD302027997996261600".     According to flipkart "They tried to reach you on the contact number provided, multiple times . However, there was no response for the same". I can gurantee that no one tried to contact for the same.     Same day 9th January I ordered for 2 items "OD302027997996261600" (Kent RO Water Purifier) &  "OD302035975013921000"(LG LED) and I received LG LED (OD302035975013921000) on 12th Feb on same address. Flipkart never tried to deliver "OD302027997996261600" because there was excuses for its delay from day one.     On the same day at same address I ordered 3 items from "Snapdeal" & 1 through "AMAZON" and I got all items delivered by 12th Feb. Now Flipkart cancelled my order and I don't know whether I will get money back or not.   I hope that I will get my money refund on my card/Account & I will never place any order through "Flipkart".  Flipkart is doing good but doesn't have a good & honest reputation in the market and now you proved and added one more person who doesn't have faith on "Flipkart".     Thanks for your support & best of luck.     Regards,  Mukesh   +91-9654845556

Dear Concern, Please refer my various trail mails, followed by your telephonic call in which you had advised me to get the report from Motorola Customer Service Centre. Accordingly I visited the Satyam Communication J-34, Sector-18, Noida but instead of repairing they informed me that as the display is damaged so we cannot repair the same and you have to pay Rs. 12500/-, they also informed me (verbally) that the display is not Corning Gorilla Glass but only top most glass is Corning Gorilla Glass and they also charged me the Rs. 200/- fee for giving the defect report. I had shocked to hear that as by seeing the specification under display it is clearly written on flipkart site that display is Corning Gorilla Glass make (which is assume to include upper most or inside glass both). In the above context, I request you to repair the device as the same is still under warranty and also provide the Customer Grievance cell escalation matrix. Regards,

I have received a email regarding cancellation of my order But i did not cancel my order.. Who told you to cancel my order.. Further, Its too much delay to deliver the product which was not expected from you..  I have made call to your customer around 3 times for my order delivery but you did not make even a single call to confirm the same and now cancelling order also without my confirmation. Why??  Yesterday your courier boy came but he was not having my packet in his Bag.. Whose fault is this??  I want my order immediately now without any further delay and excuse..   Rgfd,  Gitesh

Hi, This is surely the worst customer service I have had. It almost going to be 2 months and have NOT RECEIVED my refund. Last time which is almost 8 days back when I spoke to your senior executive name (I believe it to be Titu or Titur, you can check your records). I had reconfirmed my details yet again and he said that he had figured out what the flipkart team was doing wrong (something to do with small letters or caps) because of which my money was NOT getting refunded. Its been 8 days and still I have NOT received the refund.Can you let me know if the refund from your end as been successful. Also incase you want MORE DETAILS please do LOOK AT THIS MAIL chain for more details. The WORST EXPEREINCE ever, period. I want this resolved asap and incase it does NOT get resolved I will have to take strict action.

Dear Team,  On *10 November 2014 ,* I bought an Alcatel Onetouch Idol X+  mobile phone from Flipcart order ID - OD001231984036324400.  I am satisfied by features & unmatched price at which i have bought this device.  But, I have discovered that the phone has the following problem-  It is a duel sim phone & sim slot 1 is not working. Earlier i was using only one sim so could not realized fault during flipcart return policy.  I have visited your service center suggested by Flipcart customer executive but they are refusing for services.  Name of service center i have visited-  1) Sri Vinayaka Electronics, Abids, Hyderabad  2) SV Communications Service Center, Kukatpally, Hyderabad.  3) Mobitech Service Center, SD Road, Hyderabad.  I have tried toll free number mentioned on phone box & Official site of Alcatel - 1860 180 8877,18002748877, 0120-4744022 but nobody responding on same.I feel disappointed the way your customer care handled the query, they are saying i should try Alcatel numbers as there is no list available with us. I have waited 25 minutes as your CC executive asked to HOLD A MINUTE.   I request you to confirm whether you will arrange service for my phone & rectify manufacturing fault within next 14 days .  Yours faithfully, --   Thanks & Regards,      Rahul Chauhan  B.com(H), Chartered Accountant.  Contact No.  +91 7674025444   *"Aim for the top. There is plenty of room there.

Hi,  This is to let you know that I have received the replacement phone against the order id OD202040945075031600. This time the phone is there in the box but in damaged condition. Hats off to your excellent service. It seems that after getting the payment from the customer you just don't care for them. This is the height now. Last time you sent me an empty box without phone and this time a damaged phone. It was a gift for someone but you have ruined it all. Thanks for that and please don't say that you understand the concern as I don't need your apology. Now, I don't care about the seller policy and want the complete refund and is ready to take any legal help also for this.  Kindly do the needful at the earliest.   Regards Geeta
Order Id : OD102073971399305700  More than 24 hr has been passed and my order still is in the approval section and yet not confirmed. Whats's wrong ?
Hello, This is regarding return ID *13765096*. May I know why it is cancelled?  I was not available last week since I was out of country. I updated this information to flipkart as a responsible consumer and give two options :-  (1) change the address of pickup. (2) change the phone number.  But customer representative(and his manager) denied the possibility of any of the above and advised me to call flipkart once I am back to india.  This is really bogus as flipkart asked me to let courier person go and call us after failed delivery(please check call records).  I am really very angry as you do not have proper process to handle my case.  Request you to process refund and collect item as I am available in india now.  Regards, Antriksh Mathur +91 9953700728
Refund (Return ID: 14330642) - *ACCEPTED*  *How can you cancel my order with out my concern. Please deliver this product free of cost. It is your mistake and you have cancelled yourself. I won't accept this return simply.*  *Kannan R*

Dear Flipkart Team I am continuing this thread for a specific purpose. Please follow the thread (SIM1 slot stopped working for my purchased Moto G, 1st Gen). I did visit the Motorola Service Center during the aforementioned period and was informed that to fix my SIM1 slot, I would have to replace the motherboard and that would not be covered under warranty. As I did not want to spend an unnecessary amount and SIM2 slot was functional, I did not proceed to replace the motherboard. I have been using the phone since then with no trouble until recently. I had to update to the new OS, Android Lollipop. Alas, after the update my mobile data does not work on the phone. I have tried every possible option (re-update, reboot, factory reset, clear partition case etc.), but the problem persists. I even went to the Motorola Service Center (Sri Sai Cells, Indiranagar) but their response was to replace the motherboard or to wait for a fix from Android. Mobile data worked fine with the Kitkat OS. I cannot go back to the Kitkat OS though. I have tried using my SIM in another Moto G, 1st gen phone and the mobile data works. I even tried using another SIM in my phone, the mobile data does not work. Which leads me to assume that it is a select problem with my phone coupled with the new update to Android Lollipop. As per my research, other users have complained about SIM slots suddenly not working for Moto G. And Mobile data not working as well after the Android Lollipop update. I am at a loss as to what to do now. Mobile data is very important and I do not see a fix for this solution. Please advise. The phone is still under warranty. I hope you'll can help me out.

Flipkart,I need to bring to your attention about the problems that I'm facing withthe phone and service from Flipkart. With this email, I seek immediateaction in response.Initially you had shipped a used or unclean Nexus6( see trail mail or orderdetails for history). Hence I had asked to get it replaced. Thanks,  I wasprovided with a replacement.When I got the replacement very same day, I have noticed that there is anissue with the speaker(top speaker). When its put in max volume during acall, the audio literally gets crack. Also this is the case during an smsalert.  Initially days I thought it could be a software issue. But when Ihappened to see another Nexus 6 of my colleague , it didn't have thisproblem. Also, I have tweeted with several other nexus user group and theydidnt have this problem and claimed that it could be an hardware issue.So now I confirmed that this is an hardware issue with speaker.  I don'tunderstand why flipkart served me with such a defective product again. Thisis an expensive product so I can't bare with such faulty products.I need  to get it replaced by Wednesday as I'm available in Bangalore byWednesday. Please do initiate a replacement. Also I request, please ensurethat I will not be provided with a used (repaired or refurbished) orunclean or defective product this time!For further information , I'm available at my Mobile number 8050365385.RegardsNishan
I recently ordered a notion ink wireless keyboard for notion ink cain 8 with order no. OD001989992348483500 and I'm totally disappointed with the product. Firstly the product doesn't look like the one shown in images because the material is very cheap. The description states that it is designed for notion ink cain 8 and also acts as a case but I see that it is loose and the tablet slides from the holder whenever turned upside down making it difficult to carry around. Can I get a money refund?? Because it is highly overpriced and is totally not worth â¹2990. Please reply soon
