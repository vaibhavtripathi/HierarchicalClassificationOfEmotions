Hi team,The troubleshooting steps doesn&#39;t work, on pressing power & volume down button tab gets shut down, boot options are not shown.This is my really bad online shopping experiance. From the past 1 month I am dealing with this problem and from your side after telling the troubleshooting steps which never work, request gets closed.If flipkart can&#39;t replace the product due to unavailability, then it should compensate for the faulty product. I am also helpless that I can&#39;t return the device without resetting it and I am not getting time to approach Acer service center for the same.Naveen Singla9463954807

Hi; I am Neha and regularly buy products from Flipkart.It has been a very disappointing experience to buy the Gucci Envy Meperfume from you.I have used this perfume earlier on several occasions and the fragrance haslasted a long time; but the one that I have been delivered from Flipkart isevidently duplicate.The fragrance barely lasts 2 hours and its very sad that such practices arebeing adopted by you.This is plain cheating and I request a genuine replacement or refund ofthis fraudently delivered duplicate Gucci Envy me.Kindly solve my grievances at the earliest.Regards;Neha9810174253On 26 Dec 2014 14:50, 
*MOST URGENT*From,Mr. Jitesh J. Dhule,C/o Nitin GawadeSaidatta, Sant  Dnyaneshwar Colony, Shastri Nagar,Kothrud, PunePin â 411038Date â 15th February, 2015To,The Care Manager,Flipkart Internet Private Limited,Ozone Manay Tech Park,#56/18 & 55/09, 7th Floor,Garvebhavipalya, Hosur Road,Bangalore - 560068,Karnataka, India.*Sub :-  *Failure of in my Samsung SIII Neo handset, Pebble Blue Mobile âIMI â 352607062625849*              A request to replace the handset at your cost.*Sir/Madam,            I had ordered the new Samsung SIII Neo handset as cited aboveyour website on dt. 02/02/2015. I received said mobile on 05/02/2015.Ireally grateful for your quick service.  The said handset shows problemslike getting warm intermittently, Failure of Camera etc. from the date ofreceived. I thereafter called to your customer center and filed returnrequest on 13/02/2015. They informed me that your technical team willcontact me on14/02/2015 at 4.00 pm. But they had not contacted to me andsend massage regarding apologies and said about contacting on 15/02/2015 at2.30 pm. But again same story repeated for next day.            From the first day of purchasing I am facing difficulty with myhandset. I humbly requested you to replace the same handset as early aspossible. I hereby request your good self to kindly look into the matterand give me a justice. The fact is that when a customer spends the money tothe tune of Rs. 12,499/- he does expect that the said commodity would workat least for a reasonable period. In my case the said handset is notworking from date of purchasing and therefore it is purely a manufacturingfault or that the company is not at all bothered for its customers forreplacement.            The above facts do contradict the general experience of theFlipkart Customers and do spoil the company image. It is therefore onceagain requested that, it is my right to get my mobile replaced with a newone. I look forward to getting a prompt and favorable action from your goodself; otherwise I shall be compelled to take a legal recourse through theConsumer Court, please note.            Thanking you in anticipation,Yours Faithfully,Jitesh J. Dhule-- Thanks & Regards,Mr. Jitesh Jagannath Dhule,Mob. No. 9422162334.

Hey guys don't you have sense. How many times do I have to tell you??? I order for Loreal Paris Volume Million Lashes with Offer 9.2 ml for which L'Oreal Kajal has to be provided. Initally when contacted the team they told to return the product and will deliver a new one with the freebie. But again when I opened the box there is no L'oreal kajal which is a freebie for this product.Don't you guys have sense while sending the item. Do you think customer is a fool? Do you wish me to take this issue to court for wasting my precious time and irresponsible customer care.  I won't be available at 962936346.Kindly contact me at alternative number 8220404006.

Hi Sachin,This is regarding the recent "not so expected' experience I had withFlipkart from the last day even after being entitled as a *"Flipkart FirstCustomer".* I had placed three orders on Friday and Saturday on account ofthe sale from 13th-15th February 2015. The experiences encountered arementioned as follows -:1) *Incident -:* I had bought a pair of Adidas shoes costing after discountRs.2556 having order id  *OD002068499630065000 *on *13th Feb'15* for whichthe delivery was scheduled on *15th Feb'15* as a part of  "*IN A DAYDELIVERY*". On this Sunday, when I asked the customer care regarding thedelay in delivery, after numerous excuses they said that we cannot deliverthe product since there is a mismatch in pincode for the address mentionedby you and we have no other option to satisfy you other than cancelling it.On the contrary, when I asked them as to why they didn't inform bythemselves about it, they said it is not in our rules. According to them,e-Kart logistics has rules that it cannot deliver products assigned to someother hub.*My Thoughts* *-:* If a customer has no problem in receiving it the nextday and if delivery can be done easily *since the product is in Bangaloreonly, then why cancel it!!!!! Even the product had reached the ITPL_Hubwhich belongs to 560066 pincode, then why didn't they inform me or asked meto collect it before it was sent to Kengari Mother Hub.*2) *Incident -: *On 14th Feb'15, I had bought a Levi's belt having order ID*OD102079569721074800*â which was delivered on 15th Feb'15 only to theaddress *having pincode 560037*. Although the product was mismatching withmy size, so I had placed a request for refund and it was accepted withoutany hesitation.3) *Incident -: *On 15th Feb'15, I had bought a Titan Raga Watch havingorder ID*OD20208331009458670â0 *which was also scheduled to be delivered on 16thFeb'15* like the second one having address same as it and pincode 560037*.Today when I contacted the customer care as to why the tracking status isstill being shown as ''*Expected at mother hub KNG'',* I got the similarreply as the first incident had i.e. there was a pincode mismatch, so wecannot deliver it. For your information, the product has not been deliveredto me till now as your CS said that we've changed your pincode and deliverto you today for sure.*My Thoughts -: If my second consignment was delivered at the same addressgiven in this order, then why are they saying that there pincode mismatchwhen we tried the delivery for your product!!! *I mean simply withoutasking the customer and verifying the delivery address, how can you cancelthe delivery???? If my company's address says the same pincode, who hasgiven you the authority to negate it and do whatever you want. Is thecustomer a fool who is prepaying you and getting a response like this fromyour customer support!!!! I mean is a customer a priority or not?? When acustomer is paying you Rs.400 to be a Flipkart First customer, isn't ityour duty to serve him. *Being India's biggest online retailer, is this theimpression you are throwing on the customer!!!! *I am deeply saddened by these incidents that have taken place and wish notto encounter them in future. I hope that some effective actions will betaken in this regard and a fruitful reply would be given to me in response.Regards,*Akshun Ojha*Bangalore

Just to confirm, I've been told that my order for the laptop and screen guard will be picked up for return.  Firstly, I dont have the original packaging of the screen guard and the outer package has been torn up. So I'm not sure if it would be accepted for return by the individual.  I then received a call from an ekart executive telling me he is on his way to do the pick up of the items. I told him I have some data on the laptop I need to move first. He told me to inform you guys otherwise no one will come to pick it up the next day. So this is me informing you guys. If anything, you have my phone number to reach me. Feel free to call for any clarifications.

Hi, I ordered a Nokia Lumia 530 (Order Id: OD302053545933255200) from Flipkart and the product was delivered to me on 14/2/2015. The product that I received was a damaged product. The phone is broken on the bottom side. The seal of the package was tampered and open. Even the battery had no seal and it also seems to be a duplicate one. So, please refund me my money back.  I had a conversation with one of your representatives named "Divya" and she asked me to mail my bank account details as your system was working faulty when IFSC code was provided. Even I too tried it and found it to be faulty. So, the bank account details are as follows:  Name: SUSMITA HAZRA Bank: INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Account No: 357901000000361 IFSCCode: IOBA0003579 Branch: Kestopur, Kolkata, WestBengal.  As neither me nor your representative is able to raise a return request from your system so please arrange a return for this damaged product(Order Id: OD302053545933255200) and refund the amount of Rs.5250 in the above mentioned bank account as soon as possible.  Mobile No. used at the time of order is: 9831470404 and please send details about pick up and refund in this mobile number.  I wanted to gift this mobile to my mother and the product turned out to be a damaged one. Never expected such harassment from Flipkart. Please arrange a return for the product and refund me the money at the earliest.  Regards, Soumadipta Hazra Mob: 9831470404

Dear Team,  I am writing to you with regards to the product (moto g2) which was delivered to me 10days back. The phone received by me isn't working properly (lagging a lot & speakers are not working properly when volume is high). I tried placing my request for the replacement of the product when I was told to follow few trouble shooting steps.  Post following the steps I couldn't see much difference with the performance of Moto g2.  I kindly request you to get the product replaced with the new one as I am highly unsatisfied with the performance of the product.  It would be appreciable if you can deliver the new product & arrange for a pick up at the same address i.e. (117 / 487 pandu nagar, kanpur - 208005) as I am in kanpur for my family function.  The other option is to deliver the new product at the same address where my moto G2 was delivered addressing it to Ms. Stuti Sahu  ( Stuti Sahu, Adfactors PR, City Hall, Oasis complex compound, Kamala Mills compound, Pandurang Budhkar Marg, lower Parel west, Mumbai -400013) as I will not be available till February 24. At the same time you can also send your executive to collect the old product from the address mentioned i.e. (117/487 pandu nagar, kanpur-208005).  Kindly request you to get the replacement of the product done soon because its been really long since I am chasing flipkart executives but still have not received any satisfactory action from your end.  Kindly request you to check my account (mobile - 9619060561) for any further details or let me know for any assistance.  Regards Rohit Agnihotri 9619060561

Hello,Myself Dr. S.A.Masood from New Delhi.  I am your permanent customer and frequently buyer. Few days back I have placed 3 orders of boxers of different brand. I have received one order of them.  It was cash on delivery and I paid extra 40 INR as delivery charges. The  order id: OD 102053538574948600, which I received today, when I opened this product, I was shocked because the quality of this product is worst cotton I have ever seen in my life.  In the explanation of this product was written just cotton (not written what kind of cotton). You people know better than me about quality and types of different cotton. But being aam aadmi I aslo have enough knowledge of different types of cotton like Egyptian, mercerized, Linen cotton so on... I want to return this product and get money back. Kindly pay attention on my request. Looking forward to hear from you as early as possible. Thanking you.Sincerely,Dr. S. A. MasoodMD, MPHMobile no: +91 8860115730
I would like to report to you  that my order for "For All Competitive Exams Idioms & Phrases (English) 2nd Edition"( OD301999292453975700 ) done on 5th of this month was cancelled for the third time at a stretch made with the same identical seller "WS Retail" and a  total of 100/- was refunded in my wallet for that reason for which i am grateful to flipkart,but my question is if the book is unavailable with the seller at the moment then why is it being shown available in the flipkart website.  I am really disgusted and vexed as my order was cancelled 3 times in a row after the order was confirmed with the payment method of COD.I have brought products of wide range from flipkart in recent past but i was never subjected to this type of harassment.I would just like to know whether flipkart will take any specific action against this seller or will it specifically say that the book is unavailable at the moment because both cannot coexist.IF the book is available with the seller as shown in the website then why is it not being delivered to  me for the third consecutive time.  I want some clear and fast answers about this problem and whether i will get the book in any time soon or this harassment will go on for ever.

Hi,  I am your valuable and existing customer. I have order a* Nova Titanium Blades For men NHT 1075 Trimmer* on 10th febuary. when I recieved the product i got to know by the sticker on the box it is *Nova Titanium* Blades For men *NHT 1070 *Not *Nova Titanium Blades For men NHT **1075, which i ordered.*  I called the customer care centre and inform them about the product as you gave the wrong product that cost less than what I ordered actually *NOVA 1075 *. and you charged me for that.  When I open the box i came to know actually it is not NOVA even it is a third type cheap treamer which has a nova sticker on box , so that customer will not mind about that when he will see its written nova but was the local brand which you are claiming as NOVA product as adding a sticker on someother box .  * Please open the file attachment ,look that and compare the original NOVA product box and accessories with this.*   I also want you to send me a apology letter about what you did with me ,* i will also write this mail and send all the conversation to NOVA COMPANY that what actually you are doing with their product.*  I have to give this produst to my one of relative and i gave him when he saw it was like insult and about my reputation he was blaming me that i did that ..  I will also go to consumer court and file a complaint about you .   I want claim about that , dont waste your time and my time

Dear Sir,  I'm regular customer of Flip kart. But now this time i am very disappointed ever from your service. No support from your customer executive.I purchased Lave Iris X-8 but the performance is very bad, Mobile is off automatically after sometimes. I want to flip kart to only refund my money.

Got product which has defect in backpannel & A slight manufacturing defect, But when I Complained about It to your customer service, they are saying that no one is complaining about such issue, So Is its my luck that I got a defected product?, Now they are saying go to Lenovo service Centre and show them my issue and take same in writing from them, then mail It to flipkart and then you issue me a replacement First of all If we have time then we can buy products from Retail Markets not from online Web sites, Secondly, If you are selling any product, you must take It's total responsibility, How can you tell us To go service center and all? I don't have time to do all this, If you are not accepting my return its completely fine, but I will make sure & never ever shop with you again :( Because if delivered product has any defect, you must give a replacement.

How it happened with changing the entire product and though accessories are missing with the product. I had attached the snapshots of received product and informed to your concern customer team without an delay, this is totally not good, I use to buy online from flip-kart and use to pay the transaction properly now I had received the product entirely different with missing accessories, I need immediate solution without any more delay for my product which I had ordered, look into the matter towards my need, otherwise I need to take legal step for my concern.

Dear Sir, Your person came to deliver the replacement item, and refused to hand it over because I could not give him the item that had been damaged. The item that had been damaged was a GLASS JAR IN 200 little pieces. There was no point in keeping it. *I was not told by your customer service person* at the time of reporting damaged condition to keep it to give to the delivery man. The delivery man has refused to give me the replacment Jar and has said that *I HAVE REQUESTED RETURN WHICH IS A LIE*. You have taken money for 8 items, and only given me 7. Please rectify immediately. Jehan Manekshaw On 8 February 2015 at 15:09, Flipkart Customer Support <cs

Rechargeablecells provided take 17hs to get fully charged as per the manual.Also, in the replaced camera; flash is not working.I had planned to take the camera for a small vacation; because of which Ihad opted for express shipment but thanks to WS retail and Flipkart forspoiling it.Looking forward for an early resolution.Regards ,Mukul Bawa On 12-Feb-2015 5:42 pm, 
hithis is such a worse experience with flipkart also have had good experience as well i bought two watches i intended to buy only kenneth cole but in addition bought giordano as well on account of nice image and a good price and discount so here the problem persists the color and design is entirely different as shown in the image and the real one i thought to return it on account of a wrong product but didn t return thinking it not to be expensive one yesterday i wore it for theffirst time and it was such a horrifying experience there was some activity in my office and i clapped to applaud a colleague and it fell off my wrist one of my colleague said have u bought it from ghaffar and it was really humiliating a while ago i called the customer care and spoke to sanil and another shocking thing he instead of even understanding my issue straight away said can t be done i said to transfer to senior and he denied saying he will also mention the same thing flipkart is very well known for its brand but really sorry to say it but worse customer service ever seen i bought two products on emi and want to return giordano i do not want any replacement of this product also i want to know since i bought it on emi and some interest was levied how wil this refund work i would have claimed for compensation but right now just need my entire refund for this product or else i would be forwarding a complaint to consumerccourt since am a member of it too regardsabhishek sent from my htc
For Flipkart   Hi... I purchaed a moto E phone from flipkart. After 1 month of recieveing this phone it started to automatic swich off, restart, Voice not coming during calls.. n loud speaker does not working while playing movie and and while playing Mp3. I faced very difficulty with this phone. i called to many times to flipkart but they ignored it and not replaced it. They told me go to service center finally i went to two times in delhi service center but from there they just format it and given back to me saying that it is ok. they deleted my all the data ... pics everything . My costly things msgs they deleted they i didnt said anything. now i m in chennai and i visited here services center. They told me min 3 days and max. 7 day it will take to repair it and they also told me if u will not collect the mobile after 7 days then they will charge 10 rs as a storage charge. it is also mentioned in attached bill when u can charge us for storage then we can also charge for not giving our mobile on time. i m working in a very big company, all my company work is going on through phone but as i dont have any phone i have to face so many probles my boss, client , suppliers trying to call me and they they abusing me , bcoz of non availability of phone i could not communicate on time to supplier .. due to which he got very much loss. Everytime i called ur services center they told me the parts are not available they are in transit. So it is requested to u. kindly compensate me with a min. of 10000 rupees. Niether i will go to legal action with ahigher amount.   --  Thanks,  Sazid Husain  +918098610159

From Anil Yadav 7639966465  To, Flipkart  & His service Team   i would like to deeply gratitude to all flipkart team, Customer care services and delivery services. Thanks a lot for sending me replacement Order. Thanks to flipkart team. (basically the guys who call me at 5 pm on 12 feb,He has done his job nicely.)  To WS retailer,  On the contrary i would like to express my inconvenience regrading the misplacement of the shipment delivered by WS retailer. I would also like to add that as the replacement took time to be delivered, the price of the product was reduced by Rs1500/- approx at that time. Moreover , I had to reschedule my holiday plan as i had to wait for the replacement delivery due to which i suffered alot of problem. So,i would like to ask for some rewards as the replacement cost me a loss of Rs 1500/-.  Yours faithfully Anil Yadav

Hello, This was the first time I ordered from Flipkart & it has been a terrible experience all thanks to bluedart courier service. My waybill no - 59390614555 & reference - S 82456835. The courier guy parked his van 1km away from my house & told me to collect the parcel. I told him this was highly Impossible for me. I also told him that just this morning a FedEx guy delivered a courier at my doorstep so why can&#39;t he do that ? He was so incompetent that he couldn&#39;t make any head or tail about my address. I tried to give him directions which again he failed to follow. Suddenly he cut the call. I wasted my entire day waiting for my parcel & after a few hours when I checked online, the status for my parcel was &quot; Consigned not available&quot;. How unethical & shameful is that ! I want you not just deliver my parcel at my doorstep but also to take action against this lazy lying courier guy who must hv duped many more like me. Hope you will act similarly. Thank you for your valuable time

Hello Team Flipkart.  Let me thank you for encouraging me to not buy from flipkart and switch to amazon.in (You are million miles behind comparing to your customer service).  I have order no-OD302067497824016100 which was placed on Feb-13 assuming it will get delivered to me on Feb-17 (as mentioned on portal), till date I haven't received my consignment and I have spoken to flipkart customer service team but only have been told to wait (I have made 5 calls to be precise).  You people lack service being end customer I have to beg for customer and from sellers end I haven't received any calls since yesterday and still awaiting it. Where as amazon.in shares delivery person's no so that you can call him and get update.  Please learn from them.  I am waiting for consignment and thanks for overall horrible experience,team.  I blame myself for shopping with flipkart.  Kamlesh   Sent from BlackBerryÂ® on Airtel

Dear Flipkart Customer Care,      I had ordered Giordano  Wrist Watch for Ladies, however you delivered gents watch . After receiving the same I have to hear from your customer care executive that ladies watch is not in your stock. Because of no stock of the item ordered, you are resorting to send wrong item , this is extremely frustrating and results in waste of time for the customers. It is extremely unfortunate that being a regular customer of Flipkart we are made to suffer because of wrong delivered item from your end. Please ensure to send the correct item as per the order.      Kindly find attached the declaration form for refund of Rs. 2835/- immediately in my account , also attached driving license as identity proof. Kindly take the delivery of the item and process the refund at the earliest .     Thank you-   Karunamoy Agnihotri  Mobile: 0990992647
Please make Cash on Delivery (COD) at 193502 (pincode of Bandipora district of Jammu & Kashmir). There are so many people (including ne as well) who want to place order on Flipkart, but because of unavailability of COD at this location they opt out and are disappointed. Please this is a humble request to make COD available at 193502 so we also can enjoy the online shopping experience.
my another no is if u have any doubts call to this no ad the order is genuine
Hi, Flipkart has not just caused an inconvenience but added tremendous pain pushing me to Samsung Service centers across Delhi for rectification of the products (as an Engineer, I have communicated in the first instance that the products are fake, but so Flipkart does not have the ETHICAL STRENGH to accept the mistake). As a good customer of Flipkart over the years, I followed your instructions and visited many centers of Samsung but they did not accept the product even for testing since it does not belong to them (they are correct indeed) I had to raise this matter to Samsung in writing and with a written response; had got a chance to test the product at Samsung service center and was declared that its not their product which means its a fake Samsung product. (PLEASE SEE ATTACHED COMMUNICATION from Samsung). I have given ample time to replace the product with a real Samsung make (as I bought this product based on your certification on the website that you sell Genuine products). You have given me tremendous pain over telephonic discussions, written responses; but never demonstrated an ethical behavior owning up your act of error that could have settled the issue. Now, am unable to reconcile with my self from the feeling of being cheated from one of my most trusted brands. Let me now explore all possible options including resorting to legal remedies for cheating and mis-guiding the customer in a fraudulent manner, even after communicating the problem with the supplied product that happened to be fake. Might make Samsung also a party and would request them to initiate suitable action Sreenivasa Reddy
Dear sir,  I had purchased two jeans (west 46) on 07/02/2015. It was delivered on 11/02/2015. I had checked but west is two high so I want to replace. I had called yesterday on your customer care no. They are telling now stock is empty after that when i chacked online it is showing in stock. It is very frustrating thing. I was thought that flip cart is very safest site(so far good experience also) for online purchasing thats why I preferred flip cart only (you can check history how much I had ordered) but I was wrong you all are the same. Now after this I will not buying anything thank you for your service so far...

Hi Team,  This is a B2C related query, and corporate sales will not be able to assist the customer. Please look in to below customer query and respond at email given below:  Customer Email Id: sudhir.nadar9@gmail.com Email Description: Hi, You guys are quite smart in not having any contact with the customers after a sale is done. In fact you dont leave any medium for us to talk to you. I just got delivered a vans shoe today on 17th feb, and I found it to be of bad fit. So I went to my flipkart account and I couldnt complete it as 2-3 options like bank name, bank city were not working, I dont understand this shit. Everything was working except these two. Now Im going to take you to consumer court If you dont get this product back and have my money back. So what I need u guys to do is to help me out or else be prepared to be served with notice. I hope u will understand. sudhir.nadar9@gmail.com   Regards, Corporate Sales Team

Dear Mr. Sachin,  Hope you know how your representative Ms.Bharthi talks to customer and how rude she is on calls.  I'm writing this email with dissatisfaction with regards to MI4 which I placed an order.  Got this phone to gift this phone to my brother in law unfortunately my sister gifted one plus one to him and this phone is waste now.  I told your representative that we got this to gift my bother in law but since he already got another phone this phone is a waste and I can't use it, even I told I can't resell on olx and explained consequences.  She was lest bothered to listen it was like some one had forced to talk to me,she doesn't know customer service skills.  With regards to the phone it's still in the box like the way you guys delivered it and have not even removed it out.  If you guys can't take it back I know how and whom to approach.  I hope Hugo Bara and MI team looks into the matter on flipkart talks to their customers who own mi products.  Regards, Disappointed dissatisfied customer  SHUAIB

Hi, The issue is I am not the correct person to be called. I am getting some other customer's emails to my mailbox from Flipkart.This account seems to be recently created on Feb14 when I got an email of account creation. I did not create this account, then why are these emails coming to me ? Looks like the actual person by name Divya Goyal with contact number 8007424772 (I noticed this name and number from the orders placed by her) has created an account with flipkart with an incorrect email id or using my email id. I don't even know her in the first place. So wanted to request you to approach her and get it corrected. Hope this helps ? I am getting mails which are not even meant for me. Regards, Divya

It was not my intention to write back, but after doing what you have told, still touch screen is not working properly sometimes. Thinking that it is a software problem, I've updated some apps, and also tried rebooting, wiping cache, and factory reset as you have asked to do so, not once, but many times now. I'm losing my patience now. If it was a software issue, wouldn't it have been solved when factory reset is done. The screen goes numb few minutes, then I have to wait for it to work again. I hope you people will help resolve this issue because I have had enough. I've lost a data balance every time I do a reset and reinstall apps like WhatsApp and Facebook.

Hi, I ordered a Nokia Lumia 530 (Order Id: OD302053545933255200) from Flipkart and the product was delivered to me today. The product that I received was a damaged product. The phone is broken on the bottom side. The seal of the package was tampered and open. Even the battery had no seal and it also seems to be a duplicate one. So, please refund me my money back.  I had a conversation with one of your representatives named "Divya" and she asked me to mail my bank account details as your system was working faulty when IFSC code was provided. Even I too tried it and found it to be faulty. So, the bank account details are as follows:  Name: SUSMITA HAZRA Bank: INDIAN OVERSEAS BANK Account No: 357901000000361 IFSC Code: IOBA0003579 Branch: Kestopur, Kolkata, WestBengal.  As neither me nor your representative is able to raise a return request from your system so please arrange a return for this damaged product(Order Id: OD302053545933255200) and refund the amount of Rs.5250 in the above mentioned bank account as soon as possible.  Mobile No. used at the time of order is: 9831470404 and please send details about pick up and refund in this mobile number.  I wanted to gift this mobile to my mother and the product turned out to be a damaged one. Never expected such harassment from Flipkart. Please arrange a return for the product and refund me the money at the earliest.  Regards, Soumadipta Hazra Alternate mail Id: sh_0589@yahoo.co.in Mob: 9831470404

Hello,You said the item will be delivered by Feb 18th.Â When I checked the status, it shows the order cancelled; so I called the customer care and was told its cancelled due to courier issues.WHAT THE FUCK is this? Â This is absolutely shit service you are providing.A new requestÂ #OD101984239295338300Â is created for the exchange.I had placed the original request on Feb 2 and I have still not got the correct product.Â Do whatever you want to but I want this product delivered by this SUNDAY.Â Jaimin     
Hi Team.The product is "not as described" thats why I have to select damagedproduct as a reason.The product is described as "Samsung" brand and of "aluminium" with"Silver" color. However product delivered to me is not of samsung, its aplastic material not at all sturdy.... and also the color is also notsilver ... its silver + golden.the image shown on the portal is misleading and wrong product has beenshipped.Please initiate refund. i do not want this case. I have created an onlinereturn application as well.Thank
Flipkart i am very angry from you -_-  Your service is getting worst day by day  I have ordered the Redmi Note 4g for my friend from my account 1-2 days back  He got a damaged box -_-  What the hell are you doing  I said him that i will ask replacement for you but he denied that he will not take full replacement -_-  I don't know how pathetic service flipkart is doing now a days  You are delivering phones that too with torn up boxes -_-  I want solution on this flipkart!  he had to gift it to his sister on his birthday that's today -_- he gifted it without the box only -_- just think at it once. Now he can't even ask for replacement of the product due to this reason and he is blaming me that i ordered the phone for him.  Now please solve this problem 
Hi,I had placed one day delivery order for theÂ RemingtonS2002 Hair Straightner. It was delivered on the same day. Thank you for that.I had placed this order as a Valentines day gift. The product you delivered however is a CLEAR DUPLICATE and looks USED.My friend has the same product and I have compared that to the product I received, and it confirms that the product is a CLEAR DUPLICATE.Since I gifted the CLEAR DUPLICATE product it makes me look bad and Flipkart even worse.I have had great business with Flipkart earlier but this service is much beyond disappointing.I have attached the pictures of the product delivered. Please see for yourself and let me know why you intend to sell duplicate product to your loyal customers.TheÂ RemingtonS2002 Hair Straightener cover box also looks torn and used/old.If I wanted a duplicate/used product I could have gone for OLX or quickr as the sources.This is very disappointing from your end.Since 7PM 13th Feb,2015 I have been trying to return the product and get the refund.But there seems to be a technical issue in your end due to which the order details have not been updated and the return/refund is not being possible.I have called your Â customer support team several times.I would have gone for a replacement but by the look of things I have lost trust in your service/seller. Also I wanted the product today and hence paid the extra amount for the one day delivery.But replacement would not give me the product today as it seems.Please have my order refunded/returned at the earliest.If by a miracle you can provide a NEW and ORIGINAL product today, please call me on my number mentioned below or email me.Regards,Very disapointed customer, Dipankar991644799

I have bought a camera Nikon D3300 DSLR camera, but the product delivered was not genuine, hardware specification is not same as it is mentioned in flipkart. I have requested for the replacement with good camera, which flipkart has refused mentioning it out of stock, but agreed for refund. Flipkart guy has come to collect the camera, and he is ready to take the camera without noting my account details. On asking Flipkart's customer care executive 'On Which account the refund amount will get credited?' he is not clear, first he mentioned your e-wallet, then he mentioned credit card you have used to buy it. For your information the camera is 0f Rs. 26000+, and I am not going to buy any stuff from flipkart surely after this incident, so e-wallet is not an option. Credit card used was not mine so again its not the option. I requested to note down my account details which he refused mentioning system is down. Due to uncertainity of refund, I have not given the camera to the Flipkart guy.  **Kindly resolve this issue asap.**  FYI, I have bought the camera about 20 days ago. I couldn't use it because I have to replace it. I have called more than 5 times spent almost 100 Rs in call. It is costing me about Rs.3000, if I order it now. Also my Rs.26000+ is with you for about a month for no reason.  Still you are expecting me to call again and again for the refund.  Regards, Bhushan

Hi  Flipkart Team.    I would say this is really a frustrating experience which I've experienced over here. I strongly feel that I should have purchased from the market.    Every time I end up my call by getting a commitment  that Refund would get initiated if the Pick up would not get done the same day.    Don't you thin k that you guys are harassing your customers when he has purchased a high value product & is suffering since last 20 days and every time getting false commitment.    Shame on you guys!!      With Thanks and Best Regards,  Manoj bhardwaj 9312051986
in how much time i will get the refund of jeans sent from my iphone
Hi This is in regard with my order for Moto G 2nd Generation that I had ordered. When I got the phone for the first time, it had some battery issues so I got it replaced and the phone that I returned I had applied a screen guard on its screen,as I returned it with the screen guard my screen guard got wasted that I had bought from outside. Now with the replacement phone that I have got,it's again a defective one,I have again raised a replacement request for the same and on this phone too I have applied the screen guard so again if I return this then my 2nd screen guard will get wasted for a single phone that I will return for a 3rd replacement of the phone. So,for the compensation I want flipkart to send me a screen guard for my phone because this phone does not come with one.Flipkart gave me a defective phone twice so I would expect you to do the needful now.

Team â I had ordered this headphone but found that volume buttons are not working. It seems like this head phone does not work on Moto G, but works on other phones.This information was not provided in the production description.

The trackpant was having all logos stickers tags etc, but it doesn't seems to be a new piece, this piece is quite dull.  Now you only suggest that what am i supposed to do next?  Regards

Hi, I ordered for a JBL micro wireless white and gray speaker and received it yesterday. The piece I received is completely white and have a black speaker grill while the one displayed on flipkart website while shopping has gray bezels(sides) and also speaker grill was gray... Now I am not sure if you guys have sent me the correct product or not. I am so disappointed with such ambiguity.  Also as I further inspected, on the box itself its written on back side "what's in the box" and it mentions (1 carrying case) which I didn't find in the box or package. Now this is disgustingly annoying. I don't know if the product was opened before by seller or if it is a used product. But this is unfair and trust me I am going to take this legal if you guys didn't do anything about it. Previously you guys sent me a damaged product which I returned and now accessory is missing. What the hell has happened to flipkart standards, why there is no quality check. If I call customer care and you guys start yelling out the policies. I paid for a product and that box must include everything it mentioned on the box. I don't know who Is at fault. Sent me a wrong color speaker and also carrying case is missing. I want this to be resolved as quickly as possible, or consequences will be severe.  I have attached pictures of product and the box where you can check what I am talking about.

Hello.My order no is OD202014711714100301The moment I poured oil, it started leaking and the glass part was broken. I don't hav the original packaging because it was fine when I poured the oil into it. And I jst threw the packaging. An hr later it started leaking and suddenly I realized glass part was already broken. U must start doing quality check before dispatching which I'm sure was not done.I need the replacement or any other oil dispenser at the same cost. Since I'm a regular customer to flipkart and to avoid negative feedback from my end you have to understand my problem of not having original packing. Because defect was seen after an hr, and no one will keep the packing if it's fine initially.Thanks and regards.Fariha Khan. My flipkart email is shaoork2k@yahoo.com

Hello,I have received a wrong item again. This is not the first time I amreceiving a wrong product. For the same order last time also I got a wrongproduct and raised a replacement. I got refund. When raising last ticketitself I told that the time is getting wasted. Now it's been more than 10days and I have got wrong product.I have attached the product I ordered and the item I received. This isreally a great disappointed from flipkart. I have started getting irritateddue to wrong product and they delay in delivery by the third party supplier.I haven't seen such an irresponsible behaviour from flipkart before. And ifit continues again I am sure it will lose its customer Base day by day.I raised a support ticket already and I haven't got the response yet. Iwant to remind flipkart that I have paid my flipkart subscription and inpaper it was mentioned as priority service and feel privileged.Thanks,BalajiOn 16 Feb 2015 23:08,

HiÂ On 12 Feb 2015 I had order Murcia Hand Held Bag from your website with a gift wrap. The product which I have chosen on your website and the one which I received is entirely different, I mean its like the world of difference between two. Adding to this frustration was your packaging which was also without a gift wrap.Â I am feeling ashamed to receive this low quality product as this was the valentine gift for my fiance Ms. Rabab Fatima.Attached is the picture of the original item I have order from the website and snapshot of the one I have actually received. Kindly get this item returned and deliver the item which I have originally order & with the gift wrap. ASAPÂ Regards- Honey Raz

Hello,  Firstly, I bought a moto g2 from your site. And in that phone Sim 2 didn't worked so I raised a replacement request from my flipkart account.  Now here is the thing, On 13th Feb I got a message(PFA) in my phone that my request is been proceeded and your tech team will call me. They called me on took the information about the phone. Then on 14th I got a message(PFA) that this person with this name will come and take my moto g2 package for replacement. But here is the this no one came to receive it, than In evening I got a message that sorry we were unable to pick it up, will collect the order tomorrow which is 15 Feb. Again on 15th Feb(PFA) I was waiting but nobody came to pick it up.  I mean what the hell is happening with your support team. And today when I called first time a boy told me that the problem was in me. I didn't confirm. I confirm it twice with your tech support that Sim is not working and you guys send me messages with concern person number and timing and you are telling I dint mistake.  Today is the last day of my 30 days replacement period but my package is not collect although i had asked to do it 5 days before.  I want a immediate action for this. I want my moto g2 to be replaced with the working phone.  Please do take some serious action otherwise I very well know what necessary steps should be taken.  If you guys are projecting you are best in the market then you must show that too

Hi, I installed flipkart app last night and it showed the offer of getting extra 200 off on your first order above 999 using app.  I selected 2 shoes and in the final payment page it showed the discount. But in my bank page it didn't show so i cancelled the transaction. Now I can no longer see the 200 rs discount. I want to place the order ASAP so please look into the matter and bring back that discount so i can place the order.  Thanks Rishabh 8860036269

Hi,     I presented this gift to someone because of valentine's day. But to my shock, the product is not up to the mark and is really embarrassing for me. This is second time, I had to return your product. Day by day, I am loosing faith on flipcart.   Still I have registered  myself for Lenovo A6000. I do not know, whether I get the product or not or even I get, what would be quality of the product.        Not happy this time.     Debotosh Roy  9958292947

I am very disappointed with your service. I am a daily customer of Flipkart and I even refer Flipkart to others for online shopping. But this time, your service was worse. I purchased an Asus Modem but the range of the modem was not at all good and it was not what I wanted. I'll buy another one later but before that, I want to return it. I want my refund to be processed as soon as possible. I didn't face any such a problem before but this time I unhappy with your service. I'll be obliged if you process my refund and pick up the modem. Thank You   On Wed, Feb 18, 2015 at 12:09 PM, apurva tilwani <tilwaniapurva@gmail.com> wrote:  > i want my refund > > >

Can you please send me  the  confirmation message of the above mentioned order ID,  I have not received any message on my mobile.  Last time when I purchase the  watch in discount you have not send me any message and return the product saying that you have not  picked up the phone, do not give the bull shit answer this time,  hence send me the message.

An early action in this matter will be highly appreciated.     Thanks again                                    Sincerely yours                                    Kamal K.

my order no OD202110365258818800  placed on 18th feb 2015 was cancelled by flipkart after shipment, after contacting the customer care, I was informed that my order was cancelled due to high demand, but what I want to know is that why did flipkart confirm and ship my order if they didn't have proper amount of units available with them, I deem this action highly unprofessional and demand answers as to why my order was cancelled.

Dear CS Team, Even after all that had happened recently, you people did not learn any lesson and had deliberately cancelled my order. And your CS executive Paurush, after putting the call on hold for 9 min tld me that delivery was attempted on 17th and thereafter it was cancelled. Then how come delivery was attempted on 17th itself The tracking clearly states that item was shipped from Bilaspur on 16th and was su[ppose to reach at Rangpuri Hub on 18th This is nothing less then your cheap tactics to harass customer who had been very vocal and taken serious not of your arrogance in talking disrespectfully to a lady.taking the call I am not giving up this I'm going to ply the entire recording before your MD at A-25 Sarita Vihar New Delhi SHAME on you! Its very rightly said "Good wombs deliver good babies"

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  For your kind information, you have already paid to other customers 10% of the order amount as compensation for the non delivery of the same product I.e. Lenovo A6000. I can also submit you his mail id. ( gobinda_bls@yahoo.co.in).Â  Discrimination between customers can not be permitted. Yours sincerelyBibhu Prasanna MohapatraAdvocate

?Dear Best e-commerce with worst services,?    2 consecutive orders placed via flipkart have turned out tobe flops. Both items were defective.  There will be a known statement from you all"Its sellers who sell the products" Then I think you all shouldquality check the sellers who are selling the products under your brand name. Bothproducts were ordered for gifting purpose and both got to me nothing but uttershame just because of you all. PATHETIC and such a situation is not at all inanyway portrays your customer centricity and doing the right thing for yourcustomers.  Please refer to the attached images, where it shows thatthere was no proper packaging and it was not cushioned. It might have been thatthe seller would have thought that itâs already damaged and letâs send it offâ¦This is ridiculous. And if you see the order, it was paid for gift wrapping, sodoes that not make any ring in the packaging teamsâ head that the productsshould be quality-checked?? Anyways all products you dispatch should be qualitychecked so that it saves the time and such compromising situations in socialgatherings for customers because all are paying for it, it not given for  DAMN free. Amazon is far better in ways of packaging and takes UTMOSTcare for the ordered products and ensures seller quality. They are not careless like Flipkart. Its not a good idea at all to be complacent for any reason to hamper customer experience at the cost of your customer's money and reputation. I am surely going to deactivate and close myaccount with you all and cascade such acts of carelessness and zero quality managementand assurance for items paid with money by the customers and giving them such humiliationback. Pathetic and Frustrating.  One of your Most dissatisfied customer, (How do you all care, you have so many to handle) Manojit Banerjee. Ph: 0934365547

Dear Sir/Ma'am. It's very unfortunate to express my disappointment for the product i have been waiting to receive from you since Feb 2 has reached me in well sealed pack but has some accessories missing.  While I had to replace my order (ASUS ZENFONE 501 CG) due to specification error and now that i have received new phone sent by you to me via BLUE DART. The parcel reached me in a sealed/good condition, but when i opened the phone pack, it disappointed me once again as the phone box doesn't contain earphone and the USB lead. It had phone, warranty card, manual and just the charger/adopter but the charging/data lead (USB) and the earphones are missing from the package. The package content pictures are attached here. I'm now complaining for the missing items and hope an immediate response from your end. Also the battery problem remains the same as the phone is consuming battery very fast and the rear side of the phone does really get heat-up while charging as well as during use.  Kindly make an early redressal of my complaint  THANKS    --      *With regards,Shah Aijaz  (Journalist)Srinagar Kashmir+91-9419008794; +91-8803389489.....

Hi,  I had ordered Samsung Car Adapter and Travel Adapter on 1st Feb'15. However, I received the product with broken seal. Further the manufacturing date on product does not match with the manufacturing date mentioned on product packaging. I had complained about the same to Flipkart customer support over call and they processed product replacement with assurance that I would get brand new genuine product with proper sealed package.  On 15th Feb'15 I received the replacement product which I opened before the delivery person to make sure its genuine but to my surprise the replacement product too had the seal broken with mismatch in manufacturing date as before. I asked the delivery person to take back the same but he told me to contact you for further support.  After all this headache I am going through I have started believing that Flipkart does not have any mechanism to check whether the customer receives properly sealed genuine product or not. I had been a loyal customer of Flipkart since beginning but after this incident I have to rethink before ordering anything in future as counterfeit products with broken seal are being shipped now. I am not sure how you are going to build that trust again but this has surely hurt my confidence of buying the products online.  Now, I sincerely request you to either ship genuine sealed product to me as replacement or if you are unable to do so request you to please refund my money back.  Thanks for your continued support.  Regards, Amol Kharche + 91 9552655099

Hi, My registered mobile no. is 8105966866. The above mentioned order should have ideally been delivered on 13/02/2015. I had to call the customer services on not hearing from you people till end of business. The service on the call was awful. I obviously asked a compensation be paid out for the delay. The executive said I will get a call within the next 24 hours and the order will be delivered at 9am on 16/02/2015. I did not receive any call the whole of Saturday. When I received the call on Sunday I was in the church. I tried returning the call later but to no avail.

Today i have bought a hawk bat but the size is too small to play..tough it is size no 5 but it is not up to the height as other brand offers..so i request flipkar to exchange the bat with hawk's full size bat..please...
I have bought a camera Nikon D3300 DSLR camera, but the product delivered was not genuine, hardware specification is not same as it is mentioned in flipkart. I have requested for the replacement with good camera, which flipkart has refused mentioning it out of stock, but agreed for refund. Flipkart guy has come to collect the camera, and he is ready to take the camera without noting my account details. On asking Flipkart's customer care executive 'On Which account the refund amount will get credited?' he is not clear, first he mentioned your e-wallet, then he mentioned credit card you have used to buy it. For your information the camera is 0f Rs. 26000+, and I am not going to buy any stuff from flipkart surely after this incident, so e-wallet is not an option. Credit card used was not mine so again its not the option. I requested to note down my account details which he refused mentioning system is down. Due to uncertainity of refund, I have not given the camera to the Flipkart guy.  *Kindly resolve this issue asap.*  FYI, I have bought the camera about 20 days ago. I couldn't use it because I have to replace it. I have called more than 5 times spent almost 100 Rs in call. It is costing me about Rs.3000, if I order it now. Also  my Rs.26000+ is with you for about a month for no reason.  Still you are expecting me to call again and again for the refund.  Regards, Bhushan

This is to inform you that I have received an incorrect item. Instead of Samsung Galaxy Note 4, I received blackberry Q5.  This was a gift for my brother. I have ordered for samsung galaxy note 4 on 11 feb night with a 1 day delivery and i was supposed to get the product on 13 feb.I planned to give him as a surprise on 13 night when the clock ticks 12 of 14 feb. But due to your late delivery i couldnt and gave it to my brother on 14 feb but when he opened the box in front of us there was no phone in that i felt so humiliated. I told the same to your customer care guys and i was arranged for a replacement which i was to get delivered on 16 feb by giving back the box and items of my first delivery. But  i did not get it easy way either the delivery guy refused to give me the item because according to their papers i was supposed to give him the phone along with the accessories that i got in my first delivery, but that was my concern that i didnt get a phone so was getting a replacement . So i called up your cs again and was told to meet the delivery guy and give the phone to him and they will talk with him and help me with the delivery. I did not go to office on that day for the delivery but i couldnt get it on time so went to my office to just login there and came back by 8. i called up the delivery guy he asked me to come to the facility hub or will deliver next day since it was festival for me the next day i went to their office but got it with very great difficulty because the guys there want to have a confirmation mail from your end so finally after talking to your cs for more than an hour they send a mail and i got the delivery. The supervisor in the hub facility asked me to open and check the box since i already faced lot of problem with the product, but i like a fool told him that its okay i would make my bro open it as i am gifting him the phone. After i reached home i suddenly just want to make sure about the phone before giving him, to my surprise it was some other phone about which i have never heard of a Blackberry phone Q5, i thought the box is wrong but the pack is completely sealed and brand new so i didnt open it and immediately called the cs, First you guys sent an empty box and now some other phone . This is not acceptable.   I told the CS guy that whoever will call me regarding this, call me on 18th as 17th is festival and I'll be busy. But i guess you people called me yesterday itself i was not with my phone so couldnt answer any i checked the messages yesterday night well anyways the message says someone will call me today again i will coordinate with them.  I just want my money back, send who ever you want to collect this Q5 as soon as possible. According to my convenience i will  meet the courier guy and give him the incorrect product. where ever i am comfortable with as i cannot take off from my office for this and there is no one at my home for more than a week.  Please take back your incorrect product and refund my money. I don't trust you guys anymore. I will buy a new product right away from the shop and give the belated gift.    Huh i am done with this will never try to gift a surprise to anyone atleast by buying things online. And will never buy any phone online until and unless a day comes that the product i want to buy is only available online hope that never happens .  I hope this is my first and last order on Flipkart

The product was delivered to my given address today morning but unfortunately, after opening the sealed packet I found it to be a damaged item. I contacted your customer care department regarding this issue and was advised by them to opt for the refund policy since a replacement cannot be done at this point of time, the product being out of stock right now. I, being the buyer, am not having a single account in my name at present and as a result, I am sending this copy of the Third Party Declaration Form attached along with this mail and also the copy of PAN Card of the respective account holder. I would be grateful if you kindly look into this matter and assist me with this refund as soon as possible.  Regards, Debosmita Das

Dear Customer care team/ technical headThis is to share that I received my Xiaomo mi4 on Friday 13th Feb'2015. .my phone has heating problem and battery gets discharge very quickly.I quickly requested for a return of the piece to Flipkart on 14th Feb morning and dully specifying the reason that my phone is abnormally heated after a few moment of starting any game or starting charging or after continue some time of voice call. It is very serious issue as we cannot continue a voice call due to this heat issue. I requested to change my set at the earliest otherwise it is not possible to keep continuing use of your product due to serious damage of ears. After that call, I got an sms that said my request for return has been registered and it was under process. Some Flipkart representative soon afterwards called me and told that they will put me through to the technical support. The technical support guy told me that i have to  reset the phone and do an update. He was very casual. Well, I don't know how many people do a factory reset as soon as they buy a new phone. I got a rude shock after 7 hours. I again got sms from Flipkart that the retailer has denied my request for return. I don't know how they decided that my request was not valid.this same procedure is happening since last 3 days. i call flipkart customer care and then 7-8 hrs I receive call from technical team .. so irritating. Wasting all my time in this phone issue only.I have updated my phone and still facing the same problem. It is very dangerous to use this phone. The battery gets so much heated that you can not even put it on your ear and talk and its like that the battery can burst any time. I have been following up with Flipkart since last 3 days. this is a complete harassment to the customer. if this phone has got heating problem then you should have mentioned it on your website before selling the phone.  I have purchased lot of items through Flipkart and have never faced any problem in returning or exchanging any product. This is the first time that I am being harrassed by the customer and technical team. When you have 30 day return policy why dont you take it back and replace it if the customer is not satisfied.Now I am again putting in a request to either refund my money or replace this phone asap because I cant use this phone.Do send me all the correspondence at this email id.ThanksPoonam Arora8285010024---

Dear Sir or Madam,  I am writing this letter to express my disappointment with recent (last 3) purchases&nbsp;on&nbsp;your online store. My registered mobile number/ email id are 8652467708 / hbk_1988@rediff.com.  &nbsp;Order descriptions are as follows:-  OD102004979053916600:- 7 Rainbow Self Design Fashion Georgette Sari, My original order was for pink and white color and the one which got delivered to me is in blue color. Though itâs getting replaced but for that I need to wait for another 10 days.  &nbsp;  OD101964292978753500:- Fila Rootz Sneakers, This product was ordered on 1st feb 2015 and scheduled to delivered by 5th feb 2015 but unfortunately i donât know for which reason it was postponed to&nbsp; 12th feb 2015, but flipkart failed to dispatch with the new date as well in fact they(Flipkart) even bothered to intimate me. It wasnât over yet, when I reacted regarding same I got the message that âwe are sorry for the delay flipkart executive will help you within next 24 hoursâ, next 24 hours ends up with above message again along with rescheduled delivery date for 14 feb 2015. Hope it will get dispatched by today.  &nbsp;  OD201853912123330100:- Microsoft Lumia 535, This order was placed on 19th jan 2015 and it was first incident from where I started losing trust on flipkart, I was suppose to gift this phone to someone and assumed that this will get delivered within 2-3 days as usually flipkart do and have done in past in my case, but I end up with disappointment, yes it was my bad that I assumed that order will be delivered before the delivery date. But situation turned even worst in next two(above) order.  &nbsp;  On top of all when I connected to your executive âPriyankaâ by today 14th feb 2015 it was really disgraceful and its really heading me to think about some other online stores.&nbsp; Yes I asked her to justify that my payments towards above orders are value for money, and reply I got that if flipkart is charging for any product then they are providing that product to you, but I really didnât agree with that. If I am asking for pink and getting blue color, promised to deliver within 3-5 days but not event delivered by 14 days, can you please explain how I am getting value for money?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I hope above issues will be taken seriously unlikely my orders were.    Thanks and Regards Ajeet Singh8652467708

Hi. My name is Janam Mehta. I had purchased "Rega IT HP Compaq G42-410US 65 W Adapter" on 26th December 2014. My invoice number is "2014-15-0009834" and my Order ID is "OD301628821986980300". My adapter is not charging my laptop and so I want my adapter to be replaced with a new one. So, I want to know whether or not Flipkart would replace my adapter? I had a talk with one of the courier services. They told me that if I want to courier my adapter to the company I purchased from, it would cost Rs 350. So, I now want Flipkart to take the responsibility of replacing my adapter, because I had nothing to do with my charger's no working condition. Reply me with an answer as soon as possible.
Hi, This is in context with an order which I was trying to place on my flipkart mobile app for which I was making payment through credit card.  I followed the payments steps as indicated but on final step it gave an error "Unable to reach flipkart please try again later", though I received a mesage from my bank that amount had been deducted from my credit card account.  Please check & update about this issue. Required details of item & bank message can be found in trail mail.  Item : Miraan Cotton Printed Salwaar Suit Dupatta Material  Qty : 2  MSG from bank : "Rs 1238 was spent on your Credit Card 5546XXXXXXXX5016 on 16-Feb-15 at FLIPKART INTERNET PR"  Transaction Code : 196503  Regards, Aamir Sultan 9648477777

I would like to clear one point to you being legal professional person I know point which you violated in this case by doing forged sticker pasting on it, so also it is against the CRPC &  IPC . It is not simply product quality case as it happened with online E Commerce company but it is a case of knowing cheating and fraud.  So it's crystal clear point that you should compensate me as I asked 1500 rupees otherwise just ready for legal procedure. I only give 6 hours till Evening than  I will start my legal procedure. Now it depends on you, if you don't want to give me compensation just refused me. As I have all evidence against you and sellers.  This would me my last reminder regarding it as I don't have much time for this small issue. So please fulfill my requirement. Hope you understand the issue and its legal dimensions

Hi,  Sorry to miss your call as i am out of town and will be available over email.  Actually, I wanted to order Lava IRIS x8 by EMI payment mode. Unknowingly, i paid with the wrong option of credit card than emi. When i tried to change the payment mode through the customer care, they suggested me to cancel and reorder with the correct payment mode.  So I ordered again with the new payment mode.  Kindly process my order* OD302094900664481200 with Emi payment option * and cancel the order *OD202092749281135300.*  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Hope I am clear and please do the needful.  Note: I suppose they have already cancelled and processed my refund. Thanks.   Regards Pushparaj. A 
Dear team,  Another worst product from you!! However I'm enjoying the new mobile phone but the case I ordered for this mobile is worst and not best quality.

Hello Today 14-2-15, around 1:30pm your delivery boy came with package and asked for return packet first and wanted to see the item in it. We showed him the item he said fine, and asked to sign for delivery We told him that last time there was just 1 nightsuit, so you check or let us check for 2 nightsuits in package He said i wont do that, you sign and take package, or i m going, We told him problem again. He said, fine i m going. And he just ran away, like last time. We keep on asking him to stop, but he didnt stop He was the same guy who came last time for delivery I told you in my first email of complaint that after taking payment he just ran away This time also, he just ran away. Is there some kind of problem with your delivery boys? I order from myntra and amazon also, they do not have such rude workforce. They never hav any problem with opening of packages, and even if i hav to return, they say it politely that, contact the customercare and ur package will be picked for return later. I wud appreciate if you arrange the delivery of 2 night suits i ordered and that too by some other delivery boy. On 7 Feb 2015 21:53, "Flipkart Customer Support" <cs

As I am a regular customer of the flipkartand this time i am completely disappointed.Major problems-1. Vibration feature is completely not working in both the ringing andsilent mode.2. GPS feature is also not working properly.3. Heating Problem, while playing games or heavy use for 20-25 minutes.Upper back side of phone is heating so badly.I would request you to kindly replace or return this handset. In case ofreplacement please make sure this time the handset must be completely OKand dosn't  have any problem.. Please Note- Your QC team should check itproperly before sending it to me. Else return it, because i can take riskof Rs20,000.RegardsMohit Ra

To whom it may concern,  I am writing this email to request information regarding why my order was not delivered and the lack of proper service given by one of your customer service employee.   Below are the order details:   *Order number: OD202007399139007000*  *Product: 32' LG Led TV*  *Delivery Address: *   My concern is that, as per the delivery to pin code entering space, I provided the following pin code :-362265 (Verawel). And your website shows one seller in that location. Yet after i payed for the product, after 2 weeks I get a call from courier service that the delivery is not possible to my address which was very disappointing and I also had a talk with your customer service and was promised that the delivery will be made. But the very next day delivery was canceled without any notice.Provide me with some appropriate reason for the inconvenience.    Regards, Smarth Sing

Dear Concern,     I am disappointed with the attitude shown by Flipkart to deliver my order "OD302027997996261600".     According to flipkart "They tried to reach you on the contact number provided, multiple times . However, there was no response for the same". I can gurantee that no one tried to contact for the same.     Same day 9th January I ordered for 2 items "OD302027997996261600" (Kent RO Water Purifier) &  "OD302035975013921000"(LG LED) and I received LG LED (OD302035975013921000) on 12th Feb on same address. Flipkart never tried to deliver "OD302027997996261600" because there was excuses for its delay from day one.     On the same day at same address I ordered 3 items from "Snapdeal" & 1 through "AMAZON" and I got all items delivered by 12th Feb. Now Flipkart cancelled my order and I don't know whether I will get money back or not.   I hope that I will get my money refund on my card/Account & I will never place any order through "Flipkart".  Flipkart is doing good but doesn't have a good & honest reputation in the market and now you proved and added one more person who doesn't have faith on "Flipkart".     Thanks for your support & best of luck.     Regards,  Mukesh   +91-9654845556

Dear Concern, Please refer my various trail mails, followed by your telephonic call in which you had advised me to get the report from Motorola Customer Service Centre. Accordingly I visited the Satyam Communication J-34, Sector-18, Noida but instead of repairing they informed me that as the display is damaged so we cannot repair the same and you have to pay Rs. 12500/-, they also informed me (verbally) that the display is not Corning Gorilla Glass but only top most glass is Corning Gorilla Glass and they also charged me the Rs. 200/- fee for giving the defect report. I had shocked to hear that as by seeing the specification under display it is clearly written on flipkart site that display is Corning Gorilla Glass make (which is assume to include upper most or inside glass both). In the above context, I request you to repair the device as the same is still under warranty and also provide the Customer Grievance cell escalation matrix. Regards,

I have received a email regarding cancellation of my order But i did not cancel my order.. Who told you to cancel my order.. Further, Its too much delay to deliver the product which was not expected from you..  I have made call to your customer around 3 times for my order delivery but you did not make even a single call to confirm the same and now cancelling order also without my confirmation. Why??  Yesterday your courier boy came but he was not having my packet in his Bag.. Whose fault is this??  I want my order immediately now without any further delay and excuse..   Rgfd,  Gitesh

Hi, This is surely the worst customer service I have had. It almost going to be 2 months and have NOT RECEIVED my refund. Last time which is almost 8 days back when I spoke to your senior executive name (I believe it to be Titu or Titur, you can check your records). I had reconfirmed my details yet again and he said that he had figured out what the flipkart team was doing wrong (something to do with small letters or caps) because of which my money was NOT getting refunded. Its been 8 days and still I have NOT received the refund.Can you let me know if the refund from your end as been successful. Also incase you want MORE DETAILS please do LOOK AT THIS MAIL chain for more details. The WORST EXPEREINCE ever, period. I want this resolved asap and incase it does NOT get resolved I will have to take strict action.

Dear Team,  On *10 November 2014 ,* I bought an Alcatel Onetouch Idol X+  mobile phone from Flipcart order ID - OD001231984036324400.  I am satisfied by features & unmatched price at which i have bought this device.  But, I have discovered that the phone has the following problem-  It is a duel sim phone & sim slot 1 is not working. Earlier i was using only one sim so could not realized fault during flipcart return policy.  I have visited your service center suggested by Flipcart customer executive but they are refusing for services.  Name of service center i have visited-  1) Sri Vinayaka Electronics, Abids, Hyderabad  2) SV Communications Service Center, Kukatpally, Hyderabad.  3) Mobitech Service Center, SD Road, Hyderabad.  I have tried toll free number mentioned on phone box & Official site of Alcatel - 1860 180 8877,18002748877, 0120-4744022 but nobody responding on same.I feel disappointed the way your customer care handled the query, they are saying i should try Alcatel numbers as there is no list available with us. I have waited 25 minutes as your CC executive asked to HOLD A MINUTE.   I request you to confirm whether you will arrange service for my phone & rectify manufacturing fault within next 14 days .  Yours faithfully, --   Thanks & Regards,      Rahul Chauhan  B.com(H), Chartered Accountant.  Contact No.  +91 7674025444   *"Aim for the top. There is plenty of room there.

Hi,  This is to let you know that I have received the replacement phone against the order id OD202040945075031600. This time the phone is there in the box but in damaged condition. Hats off to your excellent service. It seems that after getting the payment from the customer you just don't care for them. This is the height now. Last time you sent me an empty box without phone and this time a damaged phone. It was a gift for someone but you have ruined it all. Thanks for that and please don't say that you understand the concern as I don't need your apology. Now, I don't care about the seller policy and want the complete refund and is ready to take any legal help also for this.  Kindly do the needful at the earliest.   Regards Geeta
Order Id : OD102073971399305700  More than 24 hr has been passed and my order still is in the approval section and yet not confirmed. Whats's wrong ?
Hello, This is regarding return ID *13765096*. May I know why it is cancelled?  I was not available last week since I was out of country. I updated this information to flipkart as a responsible consumer and give two options :-  (1) change the address of pickup. (2) change the phone number.  But customer representative(and his manager) denied the possibility of any of the above and advised me to call flipkart once I am back to india.  This is really bogus as flipkart asked me to let courier person go and call us after failed delivery(please check call records).  I am really very angry as you do not have proper process to handle my case.  Request you to process refund and collect item as I am available in india now.  Regards, Antriksh Mathur +91 9953700728

Dear Flipkart Team I am continuing this thread for a specific purpose. Please follow the thread (SIM1 slot stopped working for my purchased Moto G, 1st Gen). I did visit the Motorola Service Center during the aforementioned period and was informed that to fix my SIM1 slot, I would have to replace the motherboard and that would not be covered under warranty. As I did not want to spend an unnecessary amount and SIM2 slot was functional, I did not proceed to replace the motherboard. I have been using the phone since then with no trouble until recently. I had to update to the new OS, Android Lollipop. Alas, after the update my mobile data does not work on the phone. I have tried every possible option (re-update, reboot, factory reset, clear partition case etc.), but the problem persists. I even went to the Motorola Service Center (Sri Sai Cells, Indiranagar) but their response was to replace the motherboard or to wait for a fix from Android. Mobile data worked fine with the Kitkat OS. I cannot go back to the Kitkat OS though. I have tried using my SIM in another Moto G, 1st gen phone and the mobile data works. I even tried using another SIM in my phone, the mobile data does not work. Which leads me to assume that it is a select problem with my phone coupled with the new update to Android Lollipop. As per my research, other users have complained about SIM slots suddenly not working for Moto G. And Mobile data not working as well after the Android Lollipop update. I am at a loss as to what to do now. Mobile data is very important and I do not see a fix for this solution. Please advise. The phone is still under warranty. I hope you'll can help me out.

Flipkart,I need to bring to your attention about the problems that I'm facing withthe phone and service from Flipkart. With this email, I seek immediateaction in response.Initially you had shipped a used or unclean Nexus6( see trail mail or orderdetails for history). Hence I had asked to get it replaced. Thanks,  I wasprovided with a replacement.When I got the replacement very same day, I have noticed that there is anissue with the speaker(top speaker). When its put in max volume during acall, the audio literally gets crack. Also this is the case during an smsalert.  Initially days I thought it could be a software issue. But when Ihappened to see another Nexus 6 of my colleague , it didn't have thisproblem. Also, I have tweeted with several other nexus user group and theydidnt have this problem and claimed that it could be an hardware issue.So now I confirmed that this is an hardware issue with speaker.  I don'tunderstand why flipkart served me with such a defective product again. Thisis an expensive product so I can't bare with such faulty products.I need  to get it replaced by Wednesday as I'm available in Bangalore byWednesday. Please do initiate a replacement. Also I request, please ensurethat I will not be provided with a used (repaired or refurbished) orunclean or defective product this time!For further information , I'm available at my Mobile number 8050365385.RegardsNishan
I recently ordered a notion ink wireless keyboard for notion ink cain 8 with order no. OD001989992348483500 and I'm totally disappointed with the product. Firstly the product doesn't look like the one shown in images because the material is very cheap. The description states that it is designed for notion ink cain 8 and also acts as a case but I see that it is loose and the tablet slides from the holder whenever turned upside down making it difficult to carry around. Can I get a money refund?? Because it is highly overpriced and is totally not worth â¹2990. Please reply soon

Sir, I have ordered one Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG phone through flip kart. I requested replacement for the same because of battery problems. And i got a replacement too. when i requested for replacement again your executive called me and suggested me to go to a servicing center and he SAID me that I will get replacement if it too didnt work. Now when I try for refund there was no such option for refund or replacement. When i contacted your customer care center your executives are telling me that the refund can not be given because 30 days expired. It is because of your executive who has misguided me. So in this case Please let me know how to get the refund. And I expect a fast replay from your side.  Regards,      [image: Emoji]  *Renjith P Soman

When i was call on your customer  care no. 18002089898 some lady who was attends my call she told me tht  cover neither replaced with other cover or neither refundable. This is  totally cheat with me . When the images clear shows tht this is sensor  cover but in reality this is not. I was requested her tgt plz return this  cover and guve me my money back to me or second option plz replaced this  current cover with some other case . Your department was told me both the  option not avilable. Bcz of sensor cover i was spend this much amount.   Very very very bad experience.  I will never buy from flipkart in future.  Also i post this mail to many of other social media. Please at least rep of this mail and help me. On 10 Feb 2015 13:22, "Flipkart Customer Support"

Hi, As mentioned several times earlier I did receive the product on 13th Feb, but the product was a CLEAR DUPLICATE and looked USED. The same has been confirmed by your team. Please look into the issue in detail before you ask me to keep repeating my statements. That would save both our time which could be used more productively to resolve this issue. In case you are incapable to find the mails please let me know I will send them again.But please do not bother me with half info from your end. To repeat again I want to know the status of the replacement delivery expected on 15th Feb.Otherwise the refund status of the order as I will not accept the product after 15th Feb. I have also got an email regarding the closure of an incident(150215-014593).NOTHING HAS BEEN RESOLVED YET as per my knowledge. Regards, Dipankar

So, that's all? Considering I've wasted my time and money and trusted you again. And, I'm still without a headphone. Honestly, that's a very standard, dry and template based response and it definitely doesn't resolve my problem. I want some action and not your reply about the timescale when my money will be refunded. You shouldn't have taken it IN THE FIRST PLACE when you didn't give me ANYTHING. I WANT A SOLUTION!!!!!!!!

Dear Flipkart,This refers to the order id OD301967379382482800. This order was placed for 3 killer vest packs of XL size. However, Flipkart made a mistake on one pack, which contained M size. Rest of the two packs contained XL size and were okay. On the pack that contained M size, there's a sticker on the pack stating XL, but it's visible from outside that the vest is M as printed on the vest. I am attaching a photograph of the pack, which shows the external sticker of XL and if you zoom the picture, it shows M size printed on the vest by the company Killer.I have called the call center twice. Last week the representative promised that I will get the refund but I didn't get any intimation. This week again I called and explained the entire story but the representative said as per policy Flipkart cannot refund the money since it's a inner wear. While I fully understand the policy, but why should a customer suffer due to wrong shipment. I have been a regular customer of Flipkart but I feel cheated by Flipkart this time. I have not even opened this pack because the real size is visible from outside the pack itself. You can see it yourself from the photo attached. Please let Mr know how should I proceed.ThanksVineet Singhal+91 971758666

Hi,  I am Venkatasubramaniyam. My E-Mail ID is pvenkat84@gmail.com. My order ID is OD002035171047382500. I have booked ASUS Zenfone - 5 on 9th Feb 2015 against this mentioned order ID (OD002035171047382500). I have received the mobile from your flipkart executive on 11th Feb 2015 by 5.30PM. After receiving the mobile i found that there is some fault in the display. So i raised the return request immediately on 12th feb 2015 (The very next day itself) mentioning that there is some display problem in the mobile. Your customer support team has send me a message mentioning that flipkart specalist will call me on 13th Fen 2015 at 12.00PM. An Specialist from flipkart has called me on 13th Feb 2015 by 12.00PM and provided me a troubleshooting method. Adding to that he told me that if it doesn't works we will take the mobile back and replace with a new one. i tried the troubleshooting method but it doesnot works so i again i raised a return request on the same day by 5.45PM. Agianst the second return request i received a call from your specialist team on 14th feb 2015 by 3.00PM. But he didn't give me any solution for this problem. Till now i didnt receive any solution for this problem.  You should understand first i have raised the return request immediately the next day i received the mobile that too because of the display problem only. Adding to this i am not asking you to return me my money back or not asking you some other brand mobile as a replacement. I am asking a new piece of ASUS zenfone-5 only as a replacement since this mobile is defective piece. Please understand the value of 8K is a huge amount for me. If it is some other problem i can tolerate. But it is display problem. Each and everytime if see this display i got irritated. Please understand the customers situation and try to resolve this issue as soon as possible.   Thanks & Regards,  P. Venkatasubramnaiyam Mob: +91-9789087813

h gud afternoon sir mam i recently placed order of remington nose ear and eyebrow hair trimmer for men women
the product I have received is not as shown in the picture how can you beso unfair an can't bias on the basis of colourthe colour I have received is navy blue and the one I ordered was whitecolourthis is really a bad service I never expected this from your teambeing a regular customernow we think that we need to cancel the products have ordered and are aboutto comebecause your service is getting really poor.I can even send you images of this too and why me always can I know
Hi Flipkart Team,Could you please give me an explanation for the same.I don't understand why this order got cancelled without a prior intimationto the customer!!!!!!!!!To be very frank.,its seems very strange and shameful of yourorganisation!!!!I got a call from Flipkart(that too system generated....understood from themessage I got after it.,that it was from Flipkart).I called back to thenumber given in that message.Automatic reply was it will be deliveredtomorrow.Now I am getting a mail saying it got cancelled.I am doing online shopping for the past two years from various onlinestores.But this is the worst experience I had been through.And I was trusting Flipkart very much.But hereafter.,I feel I have torethink while ordering from Flipkart.Why should I unnecessarily waste timebrowsing and selecting items from your store that can end up like this!!I feel the order got cancelled maybe/mostly because the stock was over.Ifthat is the case.,have a proper account of everything before it beingdisplayed to the public.Why do you want us to waste our time browsing allthose and ordering and finally ending up unsatisfied and with a negativeimpression!!!!Please reply me asap with the proper reasons.Also hoping there will be asystem to revert it if the cancellation was not due to shortage in stocks!!!!Hope this will be taken in a positive way..Hoping for a great change onthis system!!Thanks,Aary
Dear Team,I've raised return request got captured under Replacement (Return ID:14282374) - *REQUESTED* as there was no option of selecting return product.My USB 3G card (Micromax MMX337G) is not getting detected by the product ipurchased. I wrote to TP Link technical team and they confirmed on mail(available in trail) that purchased product is not compatible with my USBdevice whereas no such disclosure of selected USB was mentioned either onyour sale page or on product description. This new product is of no use tome hence i request you to refund my amount. Since there is no option of"refund" in second part of request return, i've selecting the only optionavailable "return" but i want my return this product and want my amountback.Request you to look into the same.Regards,Siddharth979301220
Hello,I don't know how the request has been closed. I was just asked to Perform some steps which I told that I will be able to do only at night as new handset was currently not with me. So I even asked for a call back tomorrow afternoon which your person refused. I was asked to raise a fresh request.Shocked to see this mail where you have gone a step ahead to close this request.Would like to hear call recording for confirmation.Regards,Santosh-----Original Message-----From:

I am very disappointed with the service of Flipkart. I had ordered Miss Rose pearl eye shadow palette from Flipkart (see below mail for order details) but what I received was the matte eye shadow palette. This was the first time I ever ordered from Flipkart and has been a disappointment though the other 2 products I received are alright. This not being my fault, I have to go through a very long procedure of refund wherein I have to send you guys some declaration form and photo id proof stating that the name on my account (my maiden name) is my account coz I don't  have an account on my post marriage name, as registered with Flipkart, which makes no sense to me. If the account details are coming from my end, it has to be my account. I hope you guys don't  expect me to open a new account for all such transactions. Usually I get the money back in cash from other online sites from where I order and return the stuff. This not being my fault , my money is blocked with you guys till the time I don't send you the details.This is very inconvenient for me.

Sir/Madam I want to lodge a complaint against the delivery boy against my order numbers OD302043430892667700 OD302043430892667701 OD302043430892667702 as I am a working lady I gave instructions to the delivery boy to delivery the items only after 4pm as they would be no one to collect the order. But your delivery boy failed to turn up on the instructed time instead I started getting messages stating that ' we couldn't complete your delivery today. We will cal you shortly to provide further assistance' I tried to call on the delivery  boy's number which flashed on my truecaller after getting this message on the second consecutive day without any phone call from this particular agency but unfortunately and sadly nobody picked my call. I got worried about the status of order and checked the status by sending a mail to you from your site and came to know that my order has been requested to cancel. This is so untrue as I was so much looking forward to my favourite perfumes and the main attraction was good schemes on them. I don't want to loose on my order as it is not a mistake of mine. Please is it possible that you take an action against your delivering agency and resend my order... Looking forward for a positive response as I am using your website for the first time and don't want to be disheartened or carry a bad impression. Regards Akanksha Bedi

Hello Team,   It's reg the order of Tempered Glass for HTC 820 which I made on 7th February.  It was supposed to be delivered by ekart logistics on February 9th. But till date I haven't received it.  The executive named Murali C(09940251208)  was the point of contact for delivering the product.  But unfortunately I am having bitter experiences. Not delivering in the time in which he was  mentioning or was supposed to .  Not making any attempts to deliver the product and sending the message stating that delivery unsuccessful.  While I reached out to him for this message the comment which I got is "As its a holiday I thought you won't be coming to office".  Before sending the unsuccessful deliver at least he should make an attempt to reach out to us.  And I am making it as a last chance of ordering with flipkart.  I have already registered a complaint with flipkart ticketing (150214-087063).  Please do the necessary steps to make your services prompt.   Thanks  Aruna    Aruna Ramesh Smailtoccie@aol.com

Hello Team,This is* really frustrating for me* to get the defective piece again andthis time I am not going to just get it replaced.I just want my money back to my bank account not Flipkart wallet shit andyou have to arrange a pick up this time. I am not going to fight withcourier guys like I did last time and send it back to you guys as they arenot accepting it coz your WS-Retail they don't deliver products over there.I have ordered multiple products before on Flipkart and was happy and loyalcustomer with Flipkart while now this doesn't seems to work as in past Ihave recommended Flipkart to my friends and family also to my officecolleagues but now this seems to come to an end.Hope you understand my frustration and pain.*This was a gift to a family member, and this is what he had received adefective product not once but twice.**Issue with device:* First product which I had received had a batteryproblem i.e., a full charged battery was draining to zero within 10 mins.Somehow I got it replaced though not to forget the pain I had face with thecourier folks to deliver it to you guys.I received the replacement and this time it is not even getting started, itgot stuck up at Welcome screen, nothing is working no matter how many timesI have restarted it.I just want to get my money no replacement this time.Also, to mention I have couple of products inlined which I need to buy bythis week and I was thinking to use flipkart service but now I have to lookfor other options.To give you insight about what is inlined are:2 Ipads2 Case Covers for MacBook pro.2 Apple Magic Mouse2 Wireless keyboard2 laptop hard case cover for travel.There are more orders yet to be made but now I have to look for otheroptions.Regards,Apoor

hi i have ordered blue color shirt as shown in the picture and deliveredwith a green ones very disappointed with the service kindly let me know if you could help me in anyway
Sir,  I am not asking for any refund or exchange. I am requesting you  to provide the fillers, beads as a part of the bean bag that has been bought. That would be appropriate for the incident. You must consider this matter seriously, as it is not our fault as customer.  If you carefully read the link, you will find the following specifications : XXXL, leather, without beans, And BEAD FILLING. How do you think the customer to understand when you have put those specifications? I request you to go through the link again and try to understand what problem the customers have while reading it. Now, I kindly request you to do me justice in this matter by providing the Bead Filling.  Please acknowledge to this mail as this is the second time, I am writing it to you as there was no response. This kind of injustice would definitely hamper you customers and your market. Expecting your mail at the earliest.   Thank You

It looks like the sellers on flipkart are having a free run with what everthey feel like. The product that was off KHI Men's checkered footie sockswith a cumulative MRP of Rs. 656/- for  a pack of 5 socks (attached images)but what was delivered to me from the seller is of very cheap quality andthe quality is such that even roadside vendors would be selling betterproducts. I have attached the images of the product i received and also theMRP of the product delivered to me is of Rs. 59/- each making it acumulative price of Rs. 295 (for the pack of 5) (again images attached withthe MRP highlighted).so it looks like the seller is a cheater, a fraudster and on top of that icalled up flipkart helpline and was told since its a no return item, theyare unable to help me.So being a consumer what should i do. I feel like being cheated not only bythat seller but also by flipkart and if i dont get the item that wasdisplayed then i think flipkart is also hand in glove with the seller incheating the consumers.A very disappointed and unhappy consumer with the lack luster attitude offlipkart consumer care

Dear Sir/Madam,It gives me immense pain and a feeling of being betrayed  by your esteemedcompany Flipkart.Please find below the mail I received from Flipkart mentioning thecancellation of my order, when I have not cancelled my order at the firstplace. I placed this order on Feb 2, 2015 and have been eagerly waiting forit to be delivered to my address.I even received a mail from flipkart yesterday mentioning that there willbe a delay in the delivery by 2 more days, yet I was ok with it and waited.How can Flipkart suddenly cancel the order when the shipment has alreadyreached more than halfway?  I am absolutely unsatisfied with thisirresponsible step taken by Flipkart. How do you expect your customers tobe loyal to you when you break their trust in this way?Thankyou so much for all the incovenience and dissatisfaction that youcaused,Unsatisfied yet, Loyal customer,Monojit Paul

I am writing to complain about the poor service i received twice from flipkart.Im really upset with the service of flipkart. I ordered moto g2. And i received a defective product. I was worried and called upon the customer care. They said they would replace the product. And the second time too i received a defective product. The power button was damaged and malfunctioning,Sim card slot 1 was not working. I really think that the product received is genuine product or not. This is really annoying to receive defective and damaged products twice. I'm really fed up with flipkart service. This time i need a proper replacement with some vouchers. I demand freebies or vouchers for the disappointment from your service.  My order id : OD201880584190376201 Contact : 9600140707

I WANT A FULL REFUND and NOT A REPLACEMENT SINCE AGAIN THIS SELLER WOULD SEND A FRAUDULENT ITEM! The order was COD, so could you at least refund back in my bank account

HI Flipkart Team, I have tried the troubleshooting steps that were provided to me in the previous mail several times but havent been able to go beyond step 5. In Step 4, I do get the 'Android in distress' symbol with a 'No comand' text below it. But no matter what I do I am unable to reach Step 7 to the WIPE DATA / FACTORY RESET option. I went ahead with the alternate option of Factory data reset within the Backup and reset section in the Mobile settings but nothing has improved so far. I am still facing network connectivity issue with the Moto G 2nd Gen phone that I purchased from Flipkart. The network signal dies off suddenly at times and doesnt work at the time I need it the most. I have faced problems with this phone on numerous occasions and I would request you to kindly replace the phone at the earliest. I am really hoping that the new phone that you provide, works the way it is supposed to. As per the details I mentioned earlier in this mail chain, Motorola majorly has connectivity issues with Moto G phones starting with IMEI nos. 3533. Request you to take this into account when you provide me with a new phone as part of the replacement policy. I do not want to end up with a faulty phone again. I would also like to know that the replacement policy and warranty period still remains intact on the new phone that you will provide starting from the date you deliver it to me? Thanks, Abhinab

Hi Team,  I ordered a Baggit Belt, Order No OD302075519574854701, but it has been returned for some unknown reason.  I am a Flipkart First customer and i expected 1 day delivery of the WS retail product. I appreciate that 180 rs has been added to my wallet as refund. But, the order has not only been delayed, it has been now returned due to some fault at your logistics end.  I paid for Flipkart First subscription to get the best service and my products on time and I had faith in you guys. More than being angry, I am disappointed that if you handle Flipkart First customers like this, then how will you handle the normal ones. I need my money's worth what I paid for being a Priority Customer.  I have shopped a lot on Flipkart, I trust your brand name and I hope this will not be repeated again. Hope to hear back from you!  Regards, Tapish Gupta

Hi,  I want to give feedback for my above order regarding the gift wrap I have opted.  I have paid Rs.30 for gift wrap but the wraping what I have I have received will cost maximum Rs.5. Only a normal wraping paper is used which we can get in market in Rs.5.  I was feeling assamed while gifting with such kind of wraping.  I am shopping in flipkart since past 3 years, but its first time I am disapponted after shopping due to this cheap quality of gift wrapping.  I request you to provide sample picture of gift wrap while placing order, so that in future other customers will not feel disapponted after paying Rs. 30 or please do not charge this much amount for wrapping.    On 2/17/15,
This mail is in reference to Order Id OD201824869630450400. I called a couple of times to your customer service helpline but still haven't got a feasible solution.    I received a pair of earphones which were not original and now is not working. Flipkart claims to sell 100% genuine products, but the trust was broken.  As the product is not genuine, the Nokia Care won't change the product for a new one, neither Flipkart is sending a new one. I am stick with a tantamount product.  Flipkart is not supposed to function like this. Highly Disappointed.  If this still continues, I will take a strict action against Flipkart. --  Rahul kumar

Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Ahmad and I'm from Budgam district of J&K state (Kashmir Province). I'm glad and satisfied to have flipkart in my country that trustworthy. I've received many a products from it. But the shameful thing always for me has been that I never hve been able to receive them at my destination but have to travel long long way to other areas for same. My area pin code is 193401 that I've several times requested you to recognize unfortunately you didn't care. I assure you there are hundreds of customers in my area interested in flipkart and your belief. Once you add to your coverage it will be very blissful for customers and flipkart too. More to it I request you to facilitate if not 100% but at least 50% of your available products. All the time I can see some mobile phones and a few tablets are shippable to Capital here called Srinagar and nothing more. Please admit that people in here wish you good and want from you good.

Hello,  I bought a Moto E from Flipkart, which was delivered on 28th January 2015,for Rs 6999/- Later i found out that it has issue with its display. The display used to go out randomly and used come back. However the phone was actually useless to me as the display used to stop working anytime. I requested for replacement of this product and a fresh piece got delivered to me on 17th February 2015. For now this new Moto E appears to working fine.  Meanwhile Flipkart announced a new price for Moto E (Rs 5999/-)  Shouldn't I have waited for 2 more weeks to get a discount of Rs 1000/- because in spite of buying the product on 28th January 2015, it was actually usable on 17th February 2015 due to a defect in product.  Considering this a special case and going by my loyalty to Flipkart, I am requesting either a cashback of Rs 1000/- or a gift voucher of the same amount from Flipkart.  Please read above text again to know the gravity of this request.  --  Thanks, Kedar Joglekar 9890873622

I have still not received the refund. Pathetic service. First, the customer service rep was insistent that the money was refunded, but when I continued to deny, he reluctantly agreed to check and, of course, it was not refunded. Amazon seems much better at keeping customers happy rather than Flipkart which is now trying its best to reach new lows in customer satisfaction. Come on, ultimately, it is my money that you are playing with. If you have not been able to deliver my product in good shape in *TWO* attempts, it is *NOT* my fault.

I am writing this email in regards to the Order # OD302058081630504100which was delivered to me recently.I would like to mention that the quality of this product [ Phone cover forGoogle nexus 4] was so poor that i cant even look at it. For â¹ 199 , i dontthink it was worth of.Adding more to my sadness and aggravation, the cover was not even fittingon the my phone.I have requested return of this product, but there was no option to refundof money! The only option was replacement of that product. I am sorry but ican take another cover of same quality or same vendor who is just sendingthe wrong and sub par quality products.Please arrange the pick up of this product and do not replace it. As thiswas COD, so return my money to my flipkart account, as i will use thiscredit to buy the cover from some better vendor.This was seriously a ridiculous product.Get back to me ASAP.Regards,Kuldeep SisodiaE-mail : lomaxomatic@gmail.comTwitter : kuldeeps_Phone: +91-9928006113

Respected Sir / Madam,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  With regards I would like to state that the delivery of my order NoÂ OD302022021776316000 was supposed to be done today. But as yet the delivery has yet not been completed. I request You to kindly change your logistics Courier Partner. Because Not only are they rude in their behaviour but also fail to do their services properly. Shopping from your site is really a great experience but to your courier partner's behaviour I refrain shopping from your site. I called to two of the Courier guys & it appeared as if they were lying. But of them replied that they are on leave. Please Check whether Employee Rajeev Prasad as well as Mr. Pradeep Kumar with Mobile No's 09643304127 & 08588895310 with Ekart logistics were on leave on 16th february 2015 or not. Because I personally called them up & inquired about my product's delivery & both of them said that they were on leave. Specially I would like to mention about Mr. Pradeep Kumar that I called him up 15-16 times, not only did he lie about his supervisor's No, but also after 2-3 calls didn't receive my phone. I am sorry to say with this kind of courier partners you would soon be leaving your Customer Base in this area. I Sincerely hope that you would look into the matter & would take some stern action against the erring employees. My Duty was to bring this issue to your Notice or else some Customer would one day some Customer of yours would be forced to Complaint either with FIR( First Information Report ) or in the Consumer Complaint Cell seriously about these employees in the coming Future. My suggestion to you is to kindly get these employees reprimanded or to serve them with a strict warning as soon as possible. Kindly Update me at the earliest about the delivery of my consignment for order NoÂ OD302022021776316000.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  I would be extremely greatful to you.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Thanking You,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Vatsalya Gupta,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Date: - 16/02/2015
Hello,  Here, I want to complain about Flipkart's inefficient courier service. A  friend of mine, who lives in Chennai, had ordered a book, named 'To Kill  a Mockingbird', for me on 9th February, 2015. She had provided my mobile  number and delivery address (Anand, Gujarat). At that time, I had got  the message telling that my order had been shipped, but yesterday, I  received another message from Flipkart telling that their courier  partner had been unable to deliver the item.  When I called Flipkart's  customer support, they told me that the order was cancelled by the  seller. Just like that, just snap......closed. They didn't even bother  to correct their mistake. That's how Flipkart treats its customers?  Avoids their complaints by giving excuses.  This is the reason, I have stopped preferring Filpkart over Amazon. And  that is why, I had told my friend to go for Amazon when she was ordering  the book. But she preferred Flipkart, giving me the reason that we  should encourage an Indian firm, instead of going for Amazon. And this  is how she got treated? Congratulations. You people certainly have lost  one more potential customer.  Another thing. You take a hell of a long delivery time. For your  information, I had ordered the same book, on the same date (9th Feb) on  Amazon to Chennai's delivery address. Amazon got it delivered on 10th  February, the very next day. Of course, you will give an excuse that it  was being delivered to a metro city so it took less time. But all I know  that Amazon wouldn't have taken more than 4 days to deliver it here in  Anand, Gujarat. Flipkart takes it the whole 7 days and on the 8th day,  to my shock, I get a message telling me that the order has been  cancelled. Really?  Now. I hope you won't be so careless to ignore this complaint. Reply to  this, I also need some further assistance from you people.  Order ID : OD102033175713157200  --  Ashish Devre (+91) 9898404734

Dear Flipkart,  I do not understand the problem with this model. During my last interaction with Rahul Bajaj one flipkart's Floor supervisor I experienced a very good customer service with respect to my problem.  I received the replaced Hand Set on 16th- Feb-2015 around 2:00 PM. In order to be sure about the quality and the performance of the handset I did a phone reset first then I started using it. But after using it for almost 36 hours I have witnessed following problems:  1. FM Radio Still turns off when I lock the screen. 2. When I tried to play a few games which required multi-touch. The multi-touch response was very bad. I tried to adjust the sensitivity of the touch but even after the adjustment with the touch the multi-touch problem was there. 3. With the earlier set the camera was good and responsive but in this one the camara is taking ages in opening.  To be honest with you guys. I have never had such a bad experience with any of my phones.  I do not need this phone at all. Please arrange a refund for me.  Regards, Raman Singh 8860638322
extremely sorry for not replyng to the call due to some reasons please go ahead with the order sent via xiaomi flipkart com

Dear Sir,*"All products sold on Flipkart are brand new and 100% genuine"*Are you serious about the above line that you add with all product listingand also with this particular product. Firstly let me make you aware thatinfant products should be most importantly hygienic than any other quality.For this product " Mickey T-Shirt and Trouser set combo" which is orderedby me on 11th of February (OD302047839654546000) and delivered today18-02-2015 please clarify whether it is a brand new product as said in thelisting.Please find the attached photographs of the item delivered by Flipkarttoday. Kindly Zoom in and see whether the baby dress delivered is hygienic.The item is soiled and is having a lot of dirt attached to it. Not on thecover but inside it. How can you decide to sell such crappy filthy item tome as a newborn baby wear?I purchased this item for giving it to a new born baby on my first visit tothe mother and child. Firstly you delayed the shipment and most importantlyyou sold me an item which can't be given to a newborn baby and motherliving in a civilized society.Now I am forced to buy something from the local store and visit the babyand mother.Meanwhile you are requested to justify the reason why such a soiled productto me at the price of brand new item.

this is regarding the above mentioned order id I do not know what the hell is going on with flipkart I ordered this product in size 9 and that was not fitting properly so I requested to create exchange with size 10. you send me a wrong product and when I called to inform that then ur agent mamatha raised a wrong request  regarding my product... i clearly mentioned on call that i received the size 10 but wrong one i do not know why the hell she mentioned that customer is having size issue so due this blonder today courie guy came to address and simply refused to pick up the product...... I explained that we informed the flipkart that we received wrong product with expected size only..... he simply refuse the pick and told us that how r u so careless that u did not know the issue with ur product and wasting our time by creating wrong complaints....  I need an answer of simple question from u guys that what was my fault >- u delivered me wrong product >- u raised a wrong request >- u refused to pick up product >- u blamed me that i raised a wrong complaint product  means everything was done by you and culprit is me........  the product was with sangeeta and she missed her classes just because of u guys as she got a msg of pick up but ur Courier guy talked in such a bad way that u did not know what exactly is the issue with ur product.... Is this the way treating a woman customer  everything done wrong from ur side and who is suffering .... customer only  never expected such a blonder service from flipkart  worst order management worst customer supports agent  was a mistake from my end that i placed an order from u guys i am disappointed by each department  worst service ever i have seen in my life.....

I have placed return request for this phone. Firstly when i received confirmation call for this return request then your customer executive mentioned wrong reason for return request, i told him that reason is battery Charging and heating issue, your customer executive mentioned battery back up and heating issue. There is difference between battery charging and battery backup. This creates confusion for me and your technical department employee who visited for checking my phone. Secondly, when i have received call from yourÂ  customer care executive then she was trying for convince me to take my return request back irrespective of what she is saying, when i was talking him about my battery issue then she told me at first time that you should not charge your phone in 0 to 5% which can result in problem in battery and when i told him that i always charge phone after 20-25% then she told me what are you saying you should always charge phone from 0 to 5% and when i told him what are you saying you are changing your commentsÂ  then she ignored it.Thirdly, your customer executive has confirmed that i will received call for confirming address and timing for come person from technical department for check my phone and after some time from this call i have received a sms fromÂ  flipkart that my return request disapproved by giving reason that issue has been resolved by communication between customer and seller, how you can lie like that and when i called again flipkart then your another customer care executive told me that he is not able to understand why i have received this sms and one person from technical department will come for check my phone and its request has already been created. Your customer care executive from which i called firstly has created all thisÂ  confusion and problem. It seems like that your customer care executive was trying to ignore my request. I never see this type of service in any website. Your customer care executive cross limits for close my return request. Do you give this type of service to all your customer who place return request. you thought thatÂ  Return request is customer problem, this is not problem of flipkart, flipkart work and responsibility was till only money received. Now this is too much. I want my phone replace fast. I didn't expect this type of service from flipkart. I will never buyÂ  anything or nor recommend anybody to buy anything from flipkart again. I didn't know that flipkart provides this types of services to their customer after money received.

I didn't expect this from FlipKart!The bag I received today was simply wrapped with a thin black plasticpolythene bag with the bill carelessly pasted over it with cellotape. I hadto carefully remove the bill so that its not damaged or torn. Verydisappointed with the kind of packaging, however the product seem to be ingood condition. Flipkart used to pack the products nicely in cartons andboxes and I used to love to open it. This one is highly disappointing. Itsworse packing than SnapDeal :/I'm happy with the product, but not with the packaging!I'm attaching these images for your referenc
Just to confirm, I've been told that my order for the laptop and screen guard will be picked up for return.  Firstly, I dont have the original packaging of the screen guard and the outer package has been torn up. So I'm not sure if it would be accepted for return by the individual.  I then received a call from an ekart executive telling me he is on his way to do the pick up of the items. I told him I have some data on the laptop I need to move first. He told me to inform you guys otherwise no one will come to pick it up the next day. So this is me informing you guys. If anything, you have my phone number to reach me. Feel free to call for any clarifications.

Dear Flipkart     I had put an order , order number : OD102088821196500700 on 16/2/1025 . (on behalf of numrata navada: addresse name)Without no reason whatsover I received a mail on 17/2/2015 stating that a refund had been initiated (again no reason given).On talking on your number with the customers care executive he again confirmed that the order had been cancelled and told me there had been a "technincal" problem. I was told the book is available and I should go and place the order again.Though I was pissed I decided to put the order in again. When I went on the site I found to my dissappointment that the book which I had ordered was out of stock or either the other versions (different retailers) were not in my price range.Clearly, the order seems to have been cancelled wothout giving any reasons whatsover due to the non-availability.It is common decency to not PUT ON DISPAY or place OUT OF STOCK notices on books you don't BEFORE THE CUSTOMER PLACES THE ORDER.also gving a reason rather than a generic "refund processed" is appreciated.Also don't cover your mistakes behind technical errors.If you don't have a book, tell us that is the reason, instead of misguiding us and making us search extensively for an elusive book within our price range which we had ordered before and has now mysteriosly gone out of stock     Quite irritiated  Mansi Gokhale

I had registered for the flash sale of MI4 mobile that was going to happen at 2PM on 17/02/15 that is today. I logged into my account much before 2PM and placed the MI4 phone in the cart as soon as sale began. Till then there was no issue. However, next hurdle was to pay for the purchase. I could click the View Cart button but page would not load or if it was loading then it was loading without any graphics. I have attached screenshot of that page herewith. So I called your customer service and talked to one Satyajit well before 2:30PM. I placed the call at 2:08PM. He tried his best to help me by talking to some team in the backend. As per their suggestion, I switched to Chrome Browser and cleared all the cookies etc but the problem would not go away. All this time Satyajit was with me on phone. At 2:25PM, he suggested that I should write to you and attach screenshot of the error page. He was also going to send this feedback to concerned team and he told me that he has noted that I have placed the call well before 2:30PM deadline to complete the purchase.Now I expect your help in completing this purchase.Let me know how to do it asap.Â Â Thanks and Regards,Rajendra DixitGokulam, 11 Manisha Society, Near Alankar Police Chowky, Lane opposite Suvarnarekha Auto Center,Karvenagar, PUNE - 411 052.

Hi, I am one of the most loyal customers of Flipkart. Almost every other day the Ekart delivery guys come home to deliver mostly prepaid goods.This is specially regarding most recent delivery at my doors made by them. I was unavailable to receive the package personally. My father tried receiving it, was refused. He was told he needed me to personally rcv it. Then I made a call on this guy's phone, telling him he can hand it over to my father(he has made several deliveries at my doorstep), he refused. Finally I had to send across my phone to merely have the shipment received! Clearly, this was a trick to trouble me n nothing else; as he could not have identified the source of message as it carried no code or something that exclusive. Please look into the matter. As I have a lot more products in the loop, yet to be delivered.Thank you. Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android

Please refer to my earlier complaint dated 14.2.2015. In this regard i would like to inform you that your product specialist called me up on14 Feb, around 6:30 PM and asked me to do some settings in the phone and assured me that after doing that problem of my phone will get resolved. I did all the settings as advised by your expert but even after doing everything the problem in my phone is still there. My phone is still getting switched of/rebooted on its own.  To make it worse, the frequency has increased now.  I always rated your website highly probably the best in our country but the kind of response i got from you in respect of this product is disappointing.  Therefore, i once again request you to look into the matter and Replace/exchange this faulty phone at the earliest.  Regards! Sangeeta Mob. 9560703196

Dear Flipkart Team,Please refer to the below email for reference. Please make a note that I have not received any communication from you after the first call where it was told that they will get back to me in 24 hrs. I had again called and spoke to the CS team and they have given another date for response.The Phone was ordered on 20th of January and received on 24th of January by my wife. I have started using this phone from 31st of Jan as I was on travel and came for a day at home. Since then I am facing the issue and it has been informed to you on 10th of Feb.I have also visited the Authorised Xiomi Service Centre in Vashi (207, Vardhaman Market, Opp Andhra Bank, Vashi, Navi Mumbai) however the service centre is shifted to the door nearby and address is not changed in the website. The Service centre person had told that they have not received the original Software from Xiomi and hence they canât take the complain. However they told me there are issues related to software and hardware both exist in the phone and Flipkart should be able to replace and help.The following are the issues related to phone1. It hangs frequently2. Many software (including the softwares provided by the MI)  gives error (refer to the screen shots)3. Frequent disconnection while charging -Hardware issue4. takes 15-20 hrs for full charging5. some time camera hangs6. SD card is not readable using the cable provided - Hardware issue7  Frequent disconnection in WiFi8. and Many more . . .I am not interested to return the product and get a refund and rest assure i have not brought this product for that. I want you to replace the phone with a new phone. Please do the needful at the earliest.Regards,Sujeet Acharya+91 98204 80706     On 10-Feb-2015, at 2:23 pm,

To whomsoever it may concern,I had ordered a variety of bedsheets in the BIG day sale of Oct. 1st. However, not all of them were to my satisfaction. After months of exchanging emails, asking you to take the bedsheets back, a few were taken back. However, the refund was never given. I have given my a/c details, but every time there is an automated response telling me there is a problem with the a/c info i have given. I have checked and double-checked, but there is nothing wrong with it. Sometime later, you have (without my consent) turned these refund amounts to e-vouchers. These products have been sitting with me for the past 3 months.I urge you to take the rest back and refund me the ENTIRE amount. I dont want the e-vouchers.Â Following are the items, which have been returned but their refund amount has been turned into e-vouchers, -Â OD100943080560800400OD000943083595906500Following are the items yet to be returned, -Â OD100942974281956700 OD200943070590877700I repeat, please refund me the entire amount in cash or transfer it into my bank a/c.Following are by bank a/c details, -Â A/c holder's name - Manoj BahetiÂ Bank name - Indian BankÂ Branch - Burra BazarÂ A/c number - 482586855Â IFS Code : IDIB000B034Please get back to me as soon as possible.Thanks,Abhimanyu Baheti

I appreciate checking all the items before the delivery. This is my third dissatisfaction with Flipkart. I am such a personality if any unacceptable thing occurs I will put it on web and widely publicize in the Media. this will be detrimental to your business. This is my warning and I would like you to correct all your mistakes otherwise the repurcusions will be very serious including legal action. I kept all my evidences ready. I appreciate sending my ordered Teddy Bear and also exchanging the blue coloured wrist watch with the black coloured one as ordered.Please call me on 07731944273 for further details.To err is human when erraser aheads the pencil you are over doing it.RegardsDr. Muralidhar Karanam242 C Block, majestic Mansion, Begumpet, Hyderabad-500016  From: cs

dear flipkart customer care executive i had recently placed two orders using cash on delivery option order no benetton sandal rs and order no the end of power to my shock i received messages and emails pertaining to the above mentioned orders regarding order no i was told that i have cancelled the order i haven t cancelled any order and in my house only my parents live so there is also no possibility that the delivery was attempted and they didn t receive also the courier company never called me i was constantly keeping an eye on the order the order no reached the allahabad hub on january but no one ever came and after two days i received an email that my cancellation request has been accepted now when i see the same product it is priced at rs regarding the second order order no the end of power which i ordered for rs i received an sms pointing out that the product has been packed and is ready for shipment but after four days i am being told that due to some reasons the product cannot be delivered and now the same product is priced at rs so if i place an order for either of the two products i will be loosing my money i want to ask why has flipkart started cheating its customer if you check my account you will find that i have been a regular customer of yours and have done huge purchasing from your website it is a pity that a company which has been so reliable has started playing tricks with its customers first you offer discount and once the order is placed you ship the product and when the product is in transit you give a very stupid reason that the cancellation request has been accepted or the item cannot be delivered due to some reasons why do you offer the discounts if you have to play these fraudulent games i want both the products but the price has been raised i shall wait for your reply before lodging an official complaint in a court because i could have purchased the same items at the same through other wesbite during the discount period but now there is no discount regards dr om prakash dwivedieditor jclcell
Dear Flipkart,  This complaint is regarding an automatic cancellation of an order that I had placed on Sunday, Feb 15. Following is the background:  1) I placed the first Order: OD002086034681480600 for the product:     *The Vanca Winter Full Sleeve Solid Women's Non-Quilted Jacket* - This was Red colour. - 1249/- I paid 1186/-     Total order value: 1186/-  I cancelled this order soon the same day since I wanted to avail the benefit of 10% off on HDFC Card for a minimum order value of 1999. After cancelling it, I placed the following order on the same day (Sunday, Feb 15)  2) The second Order: OD102086209291732000 for two products:     *The Vanca Winter Full Sleeve Solid Women's Non-Quilted Jacket* - This was Red colour and same as above - 1249/-. I paid 1067/- and     *The Vanca Winter Full Sleeve Self Design Women's Polar Fleece Jacket* - This was black colour. - 899. I paid 769/-     Total order value: 1836/-  I received a cancellation confirmation of the first order and a refund of Rs.1186/- into my account. However, today, I also received another cancellation confirmation and a refund of Rs.1067/- for the Red jacket in the second order. I never raised a cancellation request. Flipkart has cancelled this on its own! I very much wanted to buy the product. *Why was my order cancelled like this?*  I spoke to one Abhishek at your customer care@ 080 4940 0000 and he mentioned that the order was cancelled by the Vendor directly. Hence my complaint.  I wanted to avail the benefit of 10% off on HDFC card for the total value of 1999 which was available only on Sunday. Now that offer has expired.  Regards,  Deepti 8197689195

Hi,This is regarding incident 150218 - 085301. Before proceeding further letme make sure that this in no way alludes to the interaction or courtesy ofthe customer care representative.                 I think it would be better if the e - gift vouchers arevalid for life time or atleast for a couple of years. One year is too shortin case the fact that we have a voucher just escapes our memory for sometime. I am one such guy who has to suffer from this clause and as a resultloosing â¹500. This is even detrimental to the sales of the e - giftvouchers. Though I am not a management guy to weigh the pros and cons ofsuch a strategy, as an average customer, I feel it's something which needsa careful thought.-- N.S.Vidyaranya,General Secretary - Academic Affairs,IIT Indore.

Hello,  This is Vamshi Krishna S.  I have purchased 'Lenovo A6000' mobile on 4th feb, 2015. But am not at all happy with the product. Am facing issues with battery backup.  Placed request for replacement on 17th feb, 2015. Today I got a message saying they were not able to call me up and asked to call the customer service on toll free number for further assistance regarding the replacement request. I called up the customer care and were given some instructions to trouble shoot the problem but still not able to solve the problem and another problem started i.e. the phone is not at all switching on. The status of the first request regarding the replacement is showing that this has been closed. I raised another request for the replacement stating the recent issue with the phone. I request you to kindly look into this issue and do the needful at the earliest.  There were some problems like the number i call in the lenovo mobile is not able to receive call sometimes even the number is ringing. May be this will be considered as call drop problem.  I want to claim for the replacement of the mobile. We people buy the products only with the trust with your brand expecting a good product always. If this is the service we expect from you people how can we trust you.  please do the needful at the earliest.  Order : OD001990506556562300 (Lenovo A6000) First return request ID: 14392403 Second return request ID: 14459638  Thanks and regards, Vamshi Krishna S 9849997554.

hello i am confirming the order sent from yahoo mail on android
âDear Team,I would like bring this case in your knowledge so that you may help ur team to improve and not making people fool.I bought a product from your website and which was delivered to me on 9th Feb, the product was over sized and was not reasonable in terms of the qualityâ and the amount that I have paid hence I made a return request on 10th Feb and on 11th Feb evening around 7pm I got a call from somebody, he asked whether my office was closed today? I said no, it was opened for the whole day. âAnd then he said mam I was just verifying as his field guy told that the office was closed. Somehow, probably that guy managed to come to pick up the product @ 8.30pm on 11th Feb i.e. wednesday. Now the second story starts, I don't what happened with my product since then as I have not received any confirmation frm flipkart whether they have received my product or not. When I called the customercare on 13th Feb, they said according to their status pickup has not done yet. I called that field boy on the number from he called, he said mam pls make another request again for the pickup as the product was not reached to their warehouse but was there at their hub office since then. I denied them to make another picked request. And when I said I will do an escalation again u and ur team, he said I don't mind pls do it. Then today that means on 15th Feb morning they misused my account details and made another pickup request and after that they have shown that they made a pick today 15th Feb to make u fool whereasthey have already picked it up on 11th Feb from me.  So they are well aware how to make CS deptt and buyer fool.. PFA the acknowledge receipt and take an action against them for misusing my account details.Sent from my BlackBerry 10 smartphone

8Hi,My order was out for delivery yesterday and was not delivered , today again it was out for delivery and i get message from your courier partner that they could not find my address. On calling back to the person he said he has already left and delivery not possible today.After 15 - 20 orders in last 2-3 years from Flipkart delivered to the same address one day suddenly my address can not be found by flipkart.I am having a very bad time with flipkart, my last order was canceled by you now the present order you have not delivered till date, despite "Out for delivery SMS" coming two times.Your policies have also changed , for Flipkart first you have a "next day delivery" for purchases from wsretail, the option "radio mark" did not exist for my last two purchases both for WSRETAIL. If this is the service i am going to get , and if "next day delivery" has been discontinued by flipkart, why i am subscribed to Filpkart first.Please suggest if there is option to opt-out for Flipkart first, and of course my money back.Also i will wait till Sunday if your person can still not find my address , please cancel this order and give me my money back.Regards,Vikas Sharma9899595486Alternate no.  :  9599133652From: no-reply

To, The Flipkart Team       As per customer care advice, I have to state that I have placed an order of Rs 146/- with my SBI Mastercard at 3:26 PM today with u. My account debited on POS 44435124 at Flipkart Internet Private Bangalore IND. Transaction ID 504679130307 but I have not received any order number.               Kindly resolve the issue and arrange to repay me the amount at your earliest.
Hi Team  I did not order this product but i received a message on my phone 8600046561 saying ..".we have received your order no...."  It seems your customer care is also unable to track the item.  Kindly investigate the same.  Regards Vibhor Mangla

Hi Sachin,     I just placed and received my order OD002083254596880600 and I am extremely sorry to say that this is my last order with Flipkart.  I have been a loyal Flipkart customer which you can verify from my previous orders but this order has been a very bad experience.     1 hour after I received the iPad Air 2 product I saw an additional offer for 5% discount at your site.   However your customer executive denied me that offer and was told that there are no returns allowed once ordered.     Price adjustment is a normal practice followed in most online sites as well as stores.  I have had no issues in getting credits for price adjustments within a reasonable time frame from other sites like Amazon.in  I am sure 1 hour would sound like a reasonable time frame to you.     Please can you issue me a credit of Rs. 1,795 (5% of Rs. 35,900) otherwise I am afraid this is my last order with Flipkart.     Thanks  Piyush  M +9176812379

Dear sir ,                  I would like to draw your kind attention towards inconvenience caused by Flipkart service regarding my purchase of order id-OD001860713818180200 , My order delivery last date was 30th Jan but I didn't got my order in due date , on 30 Jan 2015  7:01 Pm , I got a mail and message both by flipkart team that my order has been cancel and reshipment will be done in due course . And I got new promise date that was 9th Feb 2015 and I got the same on 9th Feb 2015 . But In between this time period I called flipkart support service team many times but they didn't responded as per my expectations. For this delayed delivery I had to cancel my ticket  that was booked for 2nd Feb to Kolkata and I had to change my plan after 9th Feb . I am a working man , I had to avail leave on loss of pay to pick my order on new promise date. For all these happening I had filed a complain and I got refund of only INR 180/- as a token , I hope this is not sufficient amount that can be refunded in this case since I had to cancel my railway reservation and avail extra 10 days leave  on loss of pay. And one more thing is that I have bought this order by my credit card so I have to extra interet without using the mobile for at least 20 days ,So currently I am in loss of around 2700 INR . And the second complain is that since I received my mobile on  09/02/2015 then my warranty period should be covered till 09/02/2016 but in the invoice copy which I got on 17/02/2015 by requesting many times on your voice support service my billing date is mentioned is 31/01/2015 that means my warranty will be covered till 31/01/2016 instead of 09/02/2016 if such case happens I will loss around 9 days warranty cover loss.  So I request to your good office to recalculate the refunded amount and correct my warranty cover problem as soon as possible. I will be highly oblige you if You deal with my problem as soon as possible.  Thanking Toyaj Kumar Pandey Mob no-9807376254

Hi,  This is to inform that the Dr. D Leather pouch has just been returned to the courier as discussed due to the poor condition of the cover quality.  The cover has been returned with original packing and was returned since it was hazardous to use since it could lead to possible health ailments like allergy and the artificial leather smelled awful and if used could have led to other health issues and is not at all fit to be used as a cover.  Such a product sold by a vendor must be severely dealt with considering such a poor quality of cover and the seller be strictly banned from selling ahead unless there is a recheck of the quality of products and improvement in them.  Such a poor service is leading the demotion of the Flipkart Brand and ruining customer trust since seems due diligence is not done to perform necessary quality checks.  If you consider that the same is an act of negligence which your teams will once they see and check the product and is a true inconvenience to a genuine customer that penalty must be slapped on seller and an apology credit be also given to me aa customer, with the view that a financial impact on your sellers will make them perform as per the standards set for them.  Your teams have already understood that an apology credit worth Rs. 200/- is a mere acknowledgement towards this low service standard and inconvenience is a mere slap on vendor, but the process binds them.  If at all such acts are not repeated that need to entertain via apology credits will not be needed in future.  In place of denying and committing to an act of apology, work towards reducing such incidents especially with third party vendors.  The cover has been given to courier while now the refund is yet to initiate.  The cover was paid for in cash for the amount of Rs. 345/-  Please initiate a refund for the same in the following account as authorised by me:  Account Holder VINEET DUA  BANK CITIBANK  BANK ACCOUNT NO. 5379161229  Ifsc code CITI0000014  Looking forward to a quick resolution with expedited fund transfer and the due apology credit for the act of negligence in selling a poor quality product and inconvenience caused thereof.  Regards, Chitra Dua
Hi Flipkart Team,  I am writing for the following order that was made by me.  I need a help from you to consider my case as an exception to cater to my problems.  There has been a problem that the person I ordered the phone for is no more now Due to a cardiac attack.  There is no one I can give away such an expensive phone, in which case I wouldnât have come to you with this request.  I request humbly, and on the humanity front if you can consider my case as an exception, and take the phone back.  I am not asking for you to return me my money as refund.  Instead I am fine if you want to transfer the money into my flipkart wallet account or give me a credit note for the same, which I can utilize for my future purchases on flipkart only.  It would be of great help if you consider my case. The Phone is unopened and untouched. It is still unpacked and is a fresh box piece.  I am ready to bear the courier expenses and to any further extent that I can help you with for any of your expenses, I am ready to do.  Please Let me know your conditions and I would look into them.  Also, if you want I can provide you with any details/inputs that you may require from my end to come to any conclusion.  Hoping for a positive reply at the earliest.  Regards, Rajiv Rajani    From:
Sir ,   In the month of June I had ordered two pairs of fila sneaker from my registered id abhishe55555@gmail.com whose order id was OD40623050117 OUT OF which one of them which is FILA CLASSIC SNEAKER Got torned in the month of December.   I know there is no return policy as it has crossed your one month tenure but I still want to make you acquainted with the fact as you boast high of your customer Satisfaction. It is tempting me to feel that it was not an original Fila Sneaker as I can never believe that a brand like Fila will make a Shoe which would not even last for 6 months.   Its up to you what decision you take regarding this mail but its really disappointing from your part as being a regular customer of Flipkart I can never expect such a thing. For your convenience I am attaching the photograph of my shoes.  Warm Regards ABHISHEK MISHR

Hi Team,I received call today from your executive and he said he will offerreplacement only.May I know why?I Paid 4000 rupees extra to get upgraded product from redmi 1s.Why would I accept a product  which is downgraded not even matchingstandard of redmi 1s in terms of display, build quality and camera.If you pay extra on same brand you expect higher end product which isbetter  not downgraded. Redmi note 4G looks cheap and low in quality.Display is shit I  can see pixilation while browsing very well itcanât be HD Display.Camera is not even 2 mega pixel and its mentioned 13 mega pixel.  Howfool do you think people are?Play this marketing tricks with someone else. I will never get into this trap.Donât let me go to technicality of things I can go even deep anddeeper to get the refund done.Would be better for both of us if its get sorted out soon.INITIATE THE REFUND.Regards,Pradeep Chaudhary

Hi FlipkartThank you for the quick delivery of the order.

Flipkart delivered me a product rejected byanother customer. The box has a thick layer of dust. It contains a returnpick up acknowledgement letter dated "2014 May 29" for the same product.The shoes were little soiled & strings of threads from the laces weredangling.I bought the product for my brother. Out of excitement He wore the shoesunaware of my intentions to return the product.Very disappointed by the service.Suja

dear flipkart team , i ordered a product huawei honor holly mobile on 3 feb. and its shipped by speed post tracking number EQ145536406IN , but its not delivered to me so i called customer care and i talked to flipkart first executive  ,so he transferred my call to a ma'am and i talked to her, she agreed on reshipment and i told her to change my pincode to 492001 for safe and fast delivery, i told her to that i will pick my product by myself from warehouse and SHE AGREED ! so my product got shipped by this - WSRP0340464366 , and i want to pick this product from warehouse , because i only changed pincode of address , rest address is same, i did this for my previous order's as well, you can check this this order's - OD201743038948403400, OD001738870349750000  but your logistic team saying that they don't deliver product on warehouse and i called customer care number 2 times already but they said they can't contact logistic team, this is so bad, i'm a old member of flipkart, and never ever frustrated like this before, so can you please send a mail to logistic team that i want to pick product by myself from warehouse, tomorrow or monday, they (your logistic team ) only want a confirmation from you guys then they will deliver my product on warehouse . so please send a mail to them and tell them that i can pick product by myself from warehouse, i already waited 2 weeks , and i'm so frustrated and i cant wait again, this product was for birthday present ,but its got ruined, so please tell your logistic team to i can pick by myself or if i wont get my product this time, i swear ill leave flipkart  i know delivery policies are changed, but i didn't knew about it, so please let me pick my product this time then next time i'll never order any product on this address, tell you logistic team one time to let me pick it by myself, next time it won't happen, i don't want any reshipment or refund again , i only want this product this time because i have to gift it, that's all, just tell your logistic team to let me pick by myself, that's my only request to you, tahnks

Hello, No matter how many assurances you give it seems there is no one in your department who is looking into the fact that all these promises are being fulfilled or not. Yesterday there was an order which got delivered, they dint had the machine, still i gave them the money, order no. OD302057545673530701, today again the order came but there is no machine, OD302057545673530702, i took the package he dint had the machine, i dint paid him, as i had already informed you that if the order is above 100 Rs. i am going not going to pay in cash, i will only be paying by card. Secondly, what he went ahead and told the ekart logistics manager and presumably the police (as he said he is calling from the police station) that the packet was snatched and he was slapped. For your very kind information, the packet was taken by my wife, she dint snatched it either also no one slapped him, he dint had the machine so she said u need to bring 1. After a while he came back with the machine, and when i asked him why you dint brought the machine the first time, "he plainly said network nahin aata". I told him on my floor just walk a little distance away and restart the machine, he dint even went there and said network nahin aa raha hai, he dint even tried, just for your very kind information i too am an engineer and i have been living at this place for the last 5 yrs., and i have made card payments to FLIPKART, SNAPDEAL, AMAZON, PAYTM, REDIFF SHOPPING, Koovs where not at this very address. I know for sure that the dogs is never going to be straight, so i am not going to order anything more. Incase you want the payment of Rs. 245 INR, please ask someone to come with the machine and i will do so but before that you need to do the following: 1. *I NEED A WRITTEN APOLOGY LETTER ON YOUR LETTERPAD ON A BOND PAPER OR ELSE I AM GOING TO FILE A DEFAMATION CASE AGAINST YOUR COMPANY AND THAT CHAP BECAUSE NEITHER MY WIFE SNATCHED THE PACKET NOR I SLAPPED HIM. IF I DO NOT GET THE SAME BY MONDAY 6 PM, AT THE SAME ADDRESS THEN I AM DRAGGING YOU TO COURT FOR MALIGNING MY REPUTATION IN THE SOCIETY. I HAVE THE CCTV FOOTAGE AND WOULD WANT EACH ONE OF YOU TO LOOK AT THAT WITH EYES WIDE OPEN AND TELL ME WHERE IS THE SLAP AND WHERE IS THE PACKAGE SNATCHING INCIDENT IN IT WHEN THIS PERSON COMES. RATHER THAN THE SNATCHING, I SHOULD FILE THE FEMALE HARRASEMENT CASE AGAINST YOUR COURIER GUYS. * 2. *IF BY MONDAY 6 PM IST, 16TH FEB, THE LINE FROM YOUR WEBSITE THAT YOU GIVE AN OPTION TO PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN PAY AT YOUR HOME BY CREDIT/DEBIT CARD IS NOT REMOVED FROM YOUR WEBSITE, I WILL AGAIN DRAG YOU TO THE CONSUMER COURT FOR FOOLING THE PUBLIC WHEN YOU DO NOT PROVIDE ANY SUCH OPTION AND I HAVE CC TV FOOTAGE EMAILS AND WHAT NOT WHERE YOU HAVE ALREADY ACCEPTED YOUR MISTAKE FOR THE SAME.* THANKS FOR PROVING TIME AND AGAIN AND THAT U GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF LOOSERS UNTIL THE ABOVE 2 POINTS ARE NOT DONE, PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANYONE TO TAKE THE PAYMENT BECAUSE I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY, UNTIL AND UNLESS BOTH THE POINTS I.E. FIRST IS A DEFAMATION CASE AGAINST THAT LIER FROM YOUR COURIER DEPARTMENT AND YOUR COMPANY ALONG WITH EKART LOGISTICS. MY DAD'S A LAWYER HIMSELF SO DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE NITI GRITTIES, HE WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT, BUT FOR YOU IN ORDER TO DO BOTH U HAVE TIME TILL mONDAY 6 PM, I THINIK IT IS DECENT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU, AND UNTIL THEN AND IWILL NEVER GO FOR OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT SO PLEASE ENSURE THE ABOVE IS DONE BY 6 PM MONDAY OR YOU WILL BE FORCING TO TAKE CRIMINAL ACTION AGAINST YOU FOR AGAIN FOOLOING THIS COUNTRY BY MAKING FALSE PROMISES. Thank and please do not ruin my weekend by calling me,
To flipkart customer Care.,It is very difficult experience today  after i bought the mobile from you.and having tough day.Model : Huawei Honor Holly . pl see below your mail with Order Number,etcgot delivered to me yesterday ( 17.2.15 at 4.30 PM). i switched on todayand inserted sim card. While starting after power on, it is asking Roamingcharges will come like that. even for local incoming calls from local ppland local SMS receivieng are getting charged.  I called Huawei Customercare ( 18002096555)  immediately to avoid my extra roaming phone chargeswhich is getting charged due to this mobile set has some network or someissue as i do not know the problem. They told me to change the setting inNetwork in sim management to disable the roaming button. I did disabled it.But still roaming charges are incurring. Again today evening, i askedHuawei CC, why still this mobile set does not get corrected. He told thisset is meant for international but not for india usage. so , to return itto flipkart and get new one where suits india mode. Is it so??.  I do notknow what is going on while packing at your side when you sale to Indiancustomer. I specifically mentioned my home address clearly in my order formthat i am in pondicherry ( near to tamilnadu state in india). but it isvery surprise to have tough time after incurring 7000 INR to buy this.  Plrevert to me, what is the real issue and how can i return to it to you andhow to get back new mobile .pl note that the same Local sim card  is using by me since 10 years inanother mobile but i do not have any such roaming charges reduced. so, thisis not SIM issue or Airtel issue,it is coming only because of mobile set what you delivered huawei honorholly.what is the guarantee that new mobile set will also does not have sameproblem?pl clear my problem and having headache since bought since today morning.pl solve it by giving process to send back to youpl call me at 9585646365, since the other number what i given for orderingis now in new mobile set got from you. i switched off since roaming chargesgoing up if started using it due to above issueregdsraj

The book that I was to receive as per the website was a set of two volumes,but what I have been delivered is single volume only.The quantity one refers to one set, and not one volume. I can give anotherreasoning for that, the two volumes if I purchase in the market, that isthe real owner seller of the book, I'll get the set of two volumes in Rs.5000. Whereas I had to pay Rs. 3,224 for the book, i.e. the discountedprice payable. However, by delivering one volume I am made to feel that Ihave paid 3000 for one volume, and required to pay even over 6000 for twovolumes. If a person can buy these two volumes from the lexis nexis itselffor 5000, why will he pay 6,448 whilst purchasing from flipkart.Also, it amounts to fraud, if you look at the website it clearly says, "aset of two volumes". Whereas I was delivered first volume only. I got intouch with the customer care dept. the moment I received the book andcomplaint was registered. Kindly look into the matter and address the sameasap

To, The Flipkart Team,                                       This is in regards to the above mentioned order number which I had placed  on 13th Feb 2015 with a delivery within a day. I have always been a fan and a brand loyal of your website and have purchased many products in the past including flipkart first customer service. I am writing this mail today because you people at flipkart have spoliled my Valentine day by delivering me a bad and non working product. How can your quality control team be so careless with a product worth 3000. As I received the product today on 14th feb 2015 and just like a routine I opened the box in front of your courier partner guy Mr.Rahul and was shocked to see the brand box was in a terrible condition with full of dust and the packaging torn moreover the side panel of the watch where it gets locked is slightly rusted and the cherry on the pie is the watch is not working and when I called up your customer service department and I spoke to a lady who answered my query without any concern that due to this bad product my day has been ruined to which she replied that as per our quality control I can see that product was in a saleable condition that's why we have send it to you. M so sorry to inform you that if the product was in a good condition I would not be writing this mail to you moreover I have double proof to prove my point first that I opened the box in front of your courier boy and made a note in his courier register for the same secondly I am attaching picture of the watch and the outer box so you can judge by yourself  that what I am talking about. If this is how you would prefer to gift someone a watch from a brand like Giordano then may be u should buy it and not sell on your website and spoil peoples day and mood.          Lastly I am closing this mail that I demand an apology and also a full refund for the amount spent by me on this trash. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and do the needful asap.  Regards,  Kabir chhabria

Hi,  I have purchased Moto G2 on 7/02/2015 and on Monday(9/02/2015) it fell down in water(not in deep water), after that also mobile was working but after few hours it was automatically switched off. I went to Indiranagar's Sri sai Cell centre but they are advising it will be charged.  As per advertisement and videos the Mobile is water resistance, if it is water resistance than  why it is not working? and according to guys it is one month replacement guaranty, which is not mentioned anywhere.  I see that Service center guys are not good responsive.  I request you to replace the product ASAP, i appreciate your timely response.
return requested no call received but got sms that we tried calling please update mobile no as work is completly hampered due to ur faulty ram make it asap

Dear Flipkart,  I have been a regular and satisfied user of your services. And have never found any complaint regarding the product I purchsed through your site.  But this time I ordered 2 Top Notch T-shirts (XL size) worth Rs 749 (shipping included). But on receiving the product I found that black t-shirt is smaller than the grey one. Which is indeed a shock as both t-shirts tags claim to be of XL size. Therefore I would like to seek its replacement as early as possible.  Warm regards Mohit

Let me know, how you assign a courier agent to a pin code which have already been mentioned by the customer at the time of originating a transaction. Secondly, a courier agent, with his network details could easily verify and say to your agents that the pin code mentioned could not be reachable and you could opt for an alternative agent. So, the error is at the end of Flipkart which in turn compounded with the one of the worst courier services I have ever experienced, First Flight. Creating a sort of confrontation and inducing a pressure at the customer end, is a methodology followed by the after effect of worse competition and is the most unethical way or quality policy that your organisation follow. I also wish to inform that any transaction which I would do with Flipkart has to be through India Courier / other reputed agents who are willing to deliver at the stipulated pin code. Else, forthwith I would decline any offer in spite of their rate competitiveness. Rejeesh

Team I have finally closed this case by ordering from WS Retail as forced by Flipkart. I wish to put it on record that Flipkart is not what it advertises, but not focussed on what the customer requires. Dealing with Flipkart has been a nightmare! Regards Harshada
Dear Flipkart Team,  This e-mail is regrading the Order ID OD101774613027128000  Yesterday i recieved the replacement for the Fastrack Analog Watch(which i bought approx a month ago). When i open the box, i found that i got a used product for replacement. The product, i got as replacement, has "Sold On Flipkart" seal broken already, has no price tag, no extra cover on the watch (like on the one i got before), its buckle is also bent more than normal. All it has a already running watch, box with broken seal, and weathered warranty slip sticked on the top, inside the watch. As asked for replacement so that i could get an OK product in place of faulty product but i got a 'more Faulty' product as replacement. I request you to take this faulty product back and provide me with a genuine product in new condition. I'll be thankful to you. I'm sending images as the attachment, of the product and in-box items i got as replacement. Please check the photos and provide me with a new product as the replacement of this one. Wating for the positive reply from your side  Regards Sushant Sharm

Hi!  As discussed earlier in the telephonic conversation, I am sending the screen's shots. I would like to mention that as the problem is in the display,  the "light yellow blur spot" is not observed in the screen shots. Hence sending the photos clicked from external camera. Kindly find the fault at the bottom left corner and DO THE NEEDFUL AT THE EARLIEST. Waiting for replacement confirmation now. This is the maximum co-operation I could have. Thanking you in anticipation.!  Regards Gaurav Goel 0886644550

Hello,  I have ordered a citizen Eco-Drive watch from flipkart and had high hopes on the quality. But was truly disappointed for reasons below.  1. The box packing was not sealed, and was totally worn-out. 2. The watch did not have a new look, it seems to be a "returned" watch by someone. 3. The chronograph function is not working (big needle doesnt move when the button is pressed)  Here is a screenshot of the order.  [image: Inline images 1]  I immediately raised a request for return on the same day i received the product. I got a call from flipkart executive today after about 48 hours and did not provide any conclusive advise.All I get is we will give a call tomorrow again.  This is totally disappointing. I have high expectations from Flipkart.  Here is what I want:  1. Provide me a replacement watch that is 100% brand new and unused. 2. If the above is not possible, return my money.  Additionally, I placed an order for one more citizen watch and also not totally happy with it.Here is screenshot:  [image: Inline images 2]  Although the watch is functional and I like the model, it also looks like a "returned" watch, because the tag of the watch is not attached to it, it is not in the cover, and the seal is also tampered. When we buy products which are in this expensive range, the minimum expectation is that we get a brand new watch. I have always been happy with Flipkart service, but this time i am totally disappointed.  Please address my issues at the earliest.  Thanks Vijay 990801556

Dear Customer support,This is regarding flipkart order OD002074094434108401.I want to exchange below item but i do not see any link on your site to ask for return. Item which I want to return for exchange: "Black Panther Solid Men's Track Pants" Reason: There is mismatch in information on size chart given on product webpage on flipkart site and actual product supplied.I ordered size M because as per website size M means 32 inches i.e. 81 cm. You supplied size M which is just 71 to 76 Cm. Please send size XL for same item to match with my requirement. Please make necessary arrangement to exchange this product with size XL. Regards,Harshal KhedkarBangalore8105791490

Sir/Madam I want to lodge a complaint against the delivery boy against my order numbers OD302043430892667700 OD302043430892667701 OD302043430892667702 as I am a working lady I gave instructions to the delivery boy to delivery the items only after 4pm as they would be no one to collect the order. But your delivery boy failed to turn up on the instructed time instead I started getting messages stating that ' we couldn't complete your delivery today. We will cal you shortly to provide further assistance' I tried to call on the delivery  boy's number which flashed on my truecaller after getting this message on the second consecutive day without any phone call from this particular agency but unfortunately and sadly nobody picked my call. I got worried about the status of order and checked the status by sending a mail to you from your site and came to know that my order has been requested to cancel. This is so untrue as I was so much looking forward to my favourite perfumes and the main attraction was good schemes on them. I don't want to loose on my order as it is not a mistake of mine. Please is it possible that you take an action against your delivering agency and resend my order... Looking forward for a positive response as I am using your website for the first time and don't want to be disheartened or carry a bad impression. Regards Akanksha Bedi

Hello Today 14-2-15, around 1:30pm your delivery boy came with package and asked for return packet first and wanted to see the item in it. We showed him the item he said fine, and asked to sign for delivery We told him that last time there was just 1 nightsuit, so you check or let us check for 2 nightsuits in package He said i wont do that, you sign and take package, or i m going, We told him problem again. He said, fine i m going. And he just ran away, like last time. We keep on asking him to stop, but he didnt stop He was the same guy who came last time for delivery I told you in my first email of complaint that after taking payment he just ran away This time also, he just ran away. Is there some kind of problem with your delivery boys? I order from myntra and amazon also, they do not have such rude workforce. They never hav any problem with opening of packages, and even if i hav to return, they say it politely that, contact the customercare and ur package will be picked for return later. I wud appreciate if you arrange the delivery of 2 night suits i ordered and that too by some other delivery boy. On 7 Feb 2015 21:53, "Flipkart Customer Support" <cs

It's becoming difficult for me as I am staying in a hostel. I have already invested much of my money in marketing and the refund of the same hasn't been refunded yet. It has crossed about 4 days since the notification of my refund. I want the money by today. So, better tell your bank partners to refund the money by today itself.

This is inform with great CONCERN that the Wrangler Jeans delivered to me was not as per specified order size(30â),By tearing off the coâs size tag and marking with pen ordered size(30â) does not transform the jeans into desired size. You have supplied 81cms(32â)instead of 75cms(30ââ) which  I had ordered for. This is highly demeaning for a co. of  the stature and repute of Flipcart.In case you didnât have the desired size in stock, it would have been prudent on your part to remove the product from your catalogue instead of accepting orders and subsequently supplying wrong sizes.   Anyways, I want a replacement with the correct size  , or money back . Inform how you would do it . Thanx DEBDATTA MUKHERJEE(A highly aggrieved customer)     From:

Dear sir,  Sir, Request to ignore my earlier mail, which had few typos like 21st Feb instead of 12th Feb,and follow this email for replying  I ordered for a celkon C6* mobile, black and red colour on 12th feb and received on 14th. On opening the the package,to my disappointment, i got a gold colour piece. On my request for replacement for the colour ordered, to day, on 17th feb 15, at around 12 noon(originally scheduled for delivery on 20th Feb15), i received the replacement, vide courierAWB NoFMPP3239060897 and  to my utter dismay, there was again a gold colour piece inside. This is totally unacceptable and shows the utter disregard  of all concerned with ordering and packing etc.Especially ,in this case, your chosen seller, M/s AASHREY enterprises,HYDERABAD,appears to be utmost careless in their actions, since, even the second time they have shipped the wrong colour piece, even while the retail invoice no.15, accompanying the package clearly mentioned the colour as Black&Red. In case they do not have the required colour, M/S AASHREY,should as well decline your order, but has no right to behave this way and waste everybody's time and energy. I therefore request you to take up this matter seriously and do the needful. In case you have difficulty in getting me the Black&Red.color mobile,i suggest you to please cancel my order and arrange a refund immediately.

Sir, I am a flipkart affiliate and have a flipkart affiliate account registered with email id sumon.bosegunda@gmail.com My concern is that i dont have a P.A.N card and thus i was subjected to 20% TDS deduction. In order to save that i provided my father's PAN details. The bank account, IFSC code is mine but the PAN card registered is not mine, so will i be still subjected to 20% TDS? Also is there any fear of loosing my money?? Please respond fast.                                   Thanking You                                   Sumon Bose

This is the second time I am writing this email which is regarding gift voucher worth Rs. 5,000. We are not getting the Voucher Number and Voucher Pin on this registered email id.We have contacted your customer support team several times but we are not receiving any positive response from your side.We have spoken to several executives like Mohamad Zafar, Rohit, Raja. I don't see any urgency from your side in resolving the issue as we always get standard answer which suggest that the management has lost focus in managing customer grievances.I am repeating the story that whenever I raise complain I am getting a standard email that the problem will be solved in 2 days and a separate email with voucher number and pin will be sent to you shortly.

Hi.  i have shop many products from flipkart i've been shopping since 6 months and i have made purchase up to 18000 rupees and recently my shopping experience in flipkart is very bad for the past few orders like the very last order i have purchased and moto e grip shells and decryption is it good for 2 to 3 days but when we remove and reinsert it to the phone the grip loses its flexibility and will be non usable for future. I think only because of the street and flipkart has reduced the price of the product from 1100 to 299. I have been wasting my money flipkart from recent orders like moto e grip shell and fila avior sandals. The 2 items i have brought from flipkart were very bad i'm coming to the moto g grip shell recent order is very bad as i said it the grip lost it's flexibility. Too bad experience. I've believed in flipkart and made purchase worth rupees 18000 till now but flipkart doesn't deserve it shop on it anymore. The most think i am getting annoyed is the money i have waited for the past two orders and now please maintain the good service and good products so that in future people like me will not be suffered.Thank you

Hi,  I am your valuable and existing customer. I have order a* Nova Titanium Blades For men NHT 1075 Trimmer* on 10th febuary. when I recieved the product i got to know by the sticker on the box it is *Nova Titanium* Blades For men *NHT 1070 *Not *Nova Titanium Blades For men NHT **1075, which i ordered.*  I called the customer care centre and inform them about the product as you gave the wrong product that cost less than what I ordered actually *NOVA 1075 *. and you charged me for that.  When I open the box i came to know actually it is not NOVA even it is a third type cheap treamer which has a nova sticker on box , so that customer will not mind about that when he will see its written nova but was the local brand which you are claiming as NOVA product as adding a sticker on someother box .  * Please open the file attachment ,look that and compare the original NOVA product box and accessories with this.*   I also want you to send me a apology letter about what you did with me ,* i will also write this mail and send all the conversation to NOVA COMPANY that what actually you are doing with their product.*  I have to give this produst to my one of relative and i gave him when he saw it was like insult and about my reputation he was blaming me that i did that ..  I will also go to consumer court and file a complaint about you .   I want claim about that , dont waste your time and my time

Hi FlipkartThank you for the quick delivery of the order. Unfortunately, your servicesdid not meet my expectations.The delivery was accepted in my absence. the worst part about this Order isthe product that was sent. Flipkart delivered me a product rejected byanother customer. The box has a thick layer of dust. It contains a returnpick up acknowledgement letter dated "2014 May 29" for the same product.The shoes were little soiled & strings of threads from the laces weredangling.I bought the product for my brother. Out of excitement He wore the shoesunaware of my intentions to return the product.Very disappointed by the service.Suja

Dear Sir   I don't want the second one on the screen - Casio Youth Combination Analog Watch - for Men (Black) style code (AD141). Instead of that item I want the first one - Casio Youth Digital Watch - For Men (Black) style code (D083). I have received those two items on 13-2-15 Friday and I am okay with the first item style code (D083). And I have already contacted with your toll free number on Saturday they told me log in with your flipkart account and follow those steps. The thing is that I have clicked on the option Quality Issue, that is not the problem the thing is I need to change that item. So kindly let me know about the status of the item otherwise they will send me the same item to me again. So please get me those details as soon as possible. And I have screen captured of those items and I attached with the mail so kindly find it out.

But still i didn't get my money back in my bank account.       I sent you lots of mail with my bank statement. but no one helping me on this issue. My amount is very high. And as per banking process my refund should reflect in my bank account in 8 working days. But still its not reflecting. Every day i am checking my bank account twice. And yesterday i went to my branch with ARN code. But nothing happened.      I am requesting you, please give me my money. Don't give me more fake commitment. Put your self at my place & help me.

Dear sir Time and again I have been asking for the refund for the Pavers England Flats. Your email dated 17/02/2015 and 15/02/2015 states that the issue has been resolved but I still haven't received any refund and I am begging for my own money since a long time. All my pleas have been turned to deaf ears and the Peperone bag that I received is ripped from the bottom though the grey one is okay. I have.been a regular customer of flipkart since a very long time but I never expected such dismal quality of products and I have paid for the products and now I have to beg for my own money. Kindly generate a cheque at the earliest possible. I don't want to disclose my bank details and I believe cheque is a safe mode of transfer. Kindly do the needful at the earliest without any further delay.  Regards Akshita Kohli

Dear Team, I am forced by your customer care unit to write this mail to you. This is my registered mail id with you. I had purchased many a items from your store so far. Please refer my transactions history with you. I am deeply disappointed and highly dissatisfied this time with the purchase of Huawei Honor 6 H60-L04 mobile. The details are as below; I received the above said product on 12th Jan 2015. There was a issue with the battery. I registered the complaint online and requested for replacement on 10th Feb 2015 which was well within the replacement period. Your customer care executive contacted me on 11th Feb 2015 and suggested me to reset the mobile, charge and observe the battery life for 2 more days. He also directed me to contact the customer care post two days of observation, if issue persist. As per the direction, I observed the mobile on 12th &amp; 13th of Feb. Since the issue still persisted, I contacted your customer care unit on 14th Feb and narrated the story and requested for replacement.To my surprise, your customer care executive blindly said, the mobile is out of replacement period and that flipkart would not replace the defective unit, without probing or getting into the details.Please note, I had registered for replacement within 30 days which is governed by your terms and conditions and only as per the direction of your customer care executive I had to retain the mobile for 2 more days under observation for which I cannot be held responsible. I suspect, your customer care executives are deliberately misguiding the customers to elapse the replacement period to discourage replacement of defective units.I am completely unhappy with your service this time. Since there is no fault on my side, I would request you to look into the issue judiciously and conclude the issue within 7 days from the date of receipt of this mail.Please note I am deeply disappointed with your service and hence please initiate refund of money and not replacement.Awaiting your response. If you are unable to resolve, let me know your escalation hierarchy matrix with their contact details by return of mail.Regards,  TK Viswanath  9952918929Sent from RediffmailNG on Androi

Hi, I am very much dissatisfied with the product that was sent to me(lenovo A6000)... What is the use of having a smart phone on which I cannoteven install basic applications like whatsapp , Skype updates fromPlaystore? On the same piece I am able to download and install much biggerSystem updates indicating that there is no problem with the internetconnection on the phone...so what goes wrong when it comes to installingapplications from Playstore? Attached are some photographs that will helpyou understand what I mean. (Eleven picture attachments ... I have numberedthem 01,02,03 ...please view in the same sequence) I want my money backplease ...I dont even want to think about a replacement. Pls give me mymoney back!Order ID : OD202049873228338700First return request ID = 14313397Second return request ID = 14446873I am traveling to UK so my phone 9922957062 will not be reachable incase ifyou want to speak with me. Please call on 9922957069 (my father'snumber)....or else please respond on this email so that we can have aconversation. ..Or share a number where you will be reachable so that I cancall back. I had purchased this phone i.e. Lenovo A6000 for my father sothat we could  communicate on Skype and Whatsapp when I will be on aninternational travel. But this whole experience with this product has beenvery painful. I dont have time to do more research on a defective piecebecause I seriously need to travel to UK on Wednesday evening (18th Feb2015). SO Please give me my money back. I dont have time to try anotherpiece. In the attachments, Have a look at the time i.e. the clock in thepicture attachments and the Progress Bar (which indicates progress of thedownload) and you will understand how pathetic the phone is. Looking at thephotos you will clearly understand that while whatsapp download was inprogress, I tried accessing gmail , sent a test mail, received it, AccessedGoogle maps , searched for directions in Google maps, and all this took mevery little time indicating that the internet connection is not at all slow... infact the speed of internet connection is very good... howeverwhatsapp download, happening in the background, did not progress i.e. thedownload Progress Bar did not even progress by 1 millimeter. Why is it so?I am expecting full money back...(I repeat I dont want a replacement)ThanksGirish Zopegirishzope@gmail.comCall on 992295706

I am extremely dissatisfied with Flipkart. You spoiled everything. You are taking 22 DAYS TO DELIVER THE PRODUCT!!!!! I am such a stupid that I opted for Flipkart. It just shows utopia and nothing else. I NEED MY PRODUCT ASAP. I do not like to be rude, but you people are compelling me to be so...hate this service
I have received a email regarding cancellation of my order But i did not cancel my order.. Who told you to cancel my order.. Further, Its too much delay to deliver the product which was not expected from you..  I have made call to your customer around 3 times for my order delivery but you did not make even a single call to confirm the same and now cancelling order also without my confirmation. Why??  Yesterday your courier boy came but he was not having my packet in his Bag.. Whose fault is this??  I want my order immediately now without any further delay and excuse..   Rgfd,  Gitesh

I have made a return request of my Redmi Note 4g on 14.2.2015 <1422015>(Saturday). Your executive said that you will get  a call back from our concerned department and they will solve your problem, he also said that I will receive a call on 15 Feb 2015(Sunday) by 10am. Again when I called your executive said that your request is cancelled and he/she will make a request for second time. Then your executive said that you will receive a call from our product specialist by 7.pm and I even received a message from your side saying the same as your executive said. Now I called again by 7.15pm when "I did not get call by 7pm" again your executive said that you will receive call within 24hours. When last time I made a request it took ten long days and the 11th day I got a call. I am fedup of calling your customer care again and again. I thought you were providing the best service to your customer but now I have changed my mind. Please sovle my problem as soon as possible.

Dont tell me that yhe delivery Â date is on 19th.i know that.I am worried because you have the habit of canceling and apologiesing and refunding some peanuts. .who asked fot it.it was my fathers birthday and I coudlnt gift him anything because of your team...I ordered a micromax bolt ans you cancelled it as you couldn't deliver it. Why are you in this retail business if you cant value emotions.Â I shouldn't have used you in the first place because I know how efficient snapdeal or amazon is.if o dont receive the order on or be before 19th I will take actions.Â RegardsRaviSent from Samsung Mobile
Customer Support team  This mail is to bring to your attention the horrible experience faced by me for shopping online on your site . The aforesaid item ( a pair of Clark shoes) were ordered by me on your website on 14 th feb 2015 in the morning . Payment for the same was made in advance using my credit card on your website on the same day . While placing order the expected date of delivery stated on your website was 17 th feb 2015.  However , as no delivery was attempted on 17 th feb 2015 , I called up the helpline number mentioned on your site to know the exact status of my order as the website was still showing the expected delivery date 17th feb till late evening whereas the order was still showing " under processing" on your site .  First time I called ( around 9:36 pm on 17th feb) , call was attended by your representative named Deepak . He looked into the system and told me that there was some technical issue due to which my order was on HOLD and some concerned team will call me by 27th feb to update me as to when my order can be delivered. When I tried to ask him what was the technical problem , his behaviour got rude as if he was doing some kind of favour by answering to my queries . Since he had no convincing reply to my queries , I asked him to transfer my call to someone senior who could answer my query as to what the technical problem was there with my order and how and when it will be resolved . He put my call on endless hold and no one came to help me resolve the issue. I had no choice to disconnect the call and call back again.  Then I called again at 9:49 pm and spoke to one of your rep and he also put me on hold again ...... and he did not bother to come back to call .  I made a third useless attempt to call your helpline at 10:05 pm and this time call was answered by Umesh .  His attitude was very rude from the beginning of the call itself. He told me that my order cannot be executed as it is on hold as it is yet to be approved by flipkart . When I asked him if the product is unapproved then how it is listed on Flipkart site to be sold . While talking to him I told him that The product is still listed for sale on flipkart site then he had no answer. He was not sure also if the product can actually be delivered or not . When I asked him to Cancel the order and refund the money to me then he told me that this order cannot be cancelled also till 27th feb . He told me that I have no option but to wait till 27th feb and only then someone will inform me that my order can be delivered or not . Till then the only thing I am supposed to do is to wait for the update from flipkart team . He also told me that he was not sure as to payment for my order has come to flipkart or not . When I informed him that my credit card statement is highlighting successful payment made to flipkart then also he did not pay any heed to that .   My question is .....  1. If the order is still unapproved for a particular product then how the product is listed on        flipkart site and moreover quite surprisingly  IT IS STILL BEING SOLD ON FLIPKART SITE       ( WHEN DELIVERY FOR ALREADY SOLD PRODUCT IS STILL A BIG QUESTION ??????)  2.  No one from your team could explain the so called TECHNICAL ISSUE to me . It seems that your helpline staff is not trained enough to answer the queries of a customer and when asked more questions by a customer , they start losing their temper and start getting rude . IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL A GOOD CUSTOMER SUPPORT ?????  3.  Your staff was unable to confirm if payment has been received for my order and when I tried telling me that my credit card statement is reflecting the amount then he was not ready to take my words. If my bank is demanding the payment from me then it is hard to believe that they have failed to make payment to flipkart and also the order would not have been successfully placed also if there was no successful payment. AGAIN THIS 
Hello,I have received a wrong item again. This is not the first time I amreceiving a wrong product. For the same order last time also I got a wrongproduct and raised a replacement. I got refund. When raising last ticketitself I told that the time is getting wasted. Now it's been more than 10days and I have got wrong product.I have attached the product I ordered and the item I received. This isreally a great disappointed from flipkart. I have started getting irritateddue to wrong product and they delay in delivery by the third party supplier.I haven't seen such an irresponsible behaviour from flipkart before. And ifit continues again I am sure it will lose its customer Base day by day.Thanks,Balaj

Hi Team FlipkartI would like to appreciate your hard work to maintaining good relationshipwith your customers.I always suggest my friends to buy products only from Flipkart, and alsobought many products from Flipkart all are genuine products.Recently I have purchased One Item (Order ID: OD201885201106851201) Moto G2 Generation Smart Phone from Flipkart I was really happy Discount price onMoto G2G.Unfortunately I have received defective product (Issue with power socket),I have raised a request for replacement and replacement request has beenapproved seriously I should appreciate services from Flipkart.Finally I have received a new product from Flipkart I am happy with thatbut this time they disappointed by sending again one more defective product.The product I have received under replacement is completely not workingposition that time I was angry on Seller for sending this type of products.I have tried with different methods to power on the device and tried toreboot the device but I couldnât able to do that.Finally again I have approached your customer care executive to escalatethe issue.Next day Morning around 11:30 PM I have received a call from one of yourproduct specialist to resolve the issue.I have tried to explain the issue but she was not yet understands the issueand also she was rejected replacement and forced me to take refund.She also said me to visit Motorola service center to make repair theDevice, Here I have one doubt Why should I went Motorola service center forrepair the mobile I have received from seller is completely not workingcondition.Seller should take responsibility about this issue and also product isunder 30days replacement warranty I said the same thing to her.I was seriously not happy with her behavior and way of explanation of yourexecutive.Finally she was forced approved refund for Refund, but I donât want refund,because I have bought this device with 10% Discount Offer(12999*90/100=11699) Final price is 11699.If I want buy the same mobile again I have to spend 12999 here I am losing1300/- on this device .And also I have spent my valuable time to purchase this item.I am kindly requesting you please replace a new Moto G 2 Generation Mobilewith this defective device and also cancel refund.I believe team Filpkart will maintain valuable relationship with everycostumer who purchased items from Flipkart.Here I am Enclosing screenshots of Mobile this not working condition.I hope I will get positive response from Team Flipkart.Thanks youVamshiDhar Reddy

Hello Flipkart. Hope you are doing well by cheating your previlage customers. I am a previlage customer of flipkart and I am very much unsatisfied today after talking with Your executive. First I was upset with cancilaton of tv on big billion day. Later after getting good response from flipkart I was very happy. They called me and given option to buy another upgraded tv in same price and offer. I was clearly told that EMI interest money won't be getting as it was a new product. But other 2 offers I will be getting i.e. phillips new tv will cost me 27990 and 10% cash back I will be getting If I will book it from citi bank credit card. They told me that I will be getting cash bank by 10th of Feb. I have got rs 4300 cash back in flipkart wallet so tv cost for me was rs27990. I was very happy with good response from flipkart. Today when I enquired about 10 % cash back, response from flipkart executive.. 1. Whom you have spoken with while placing the order. ?. Any one can remember the persons name if you have spoken 2 months before? ????? 2. No we have not offered this... without checking the details he was replying. I Became lier in front of him. The way he was answering as little harsh for me as I was not expecting from flipkart. I stopped buying product from any other online portal and choose flipkart because it is fulfilling all my requirements. But I would like to say that rs 2000 is not a big amount for which any customer will tell lie . And please don't try insult any customer . I have remembered that your customer executive have assured me that I will be getting 10% cash back by 10th of Feb while placing the order. I kindly request you to check my details and do the needful. Don't think in such a way like customer will forget after 2 months. Please find the attached snapshots of my offer which was given me on big billion day. Hoping flipkart will resolve this issue as usual as now it's the matter of my prestige. Regards. Ujjwal Kashyap Mob no. 9902623523

reference order no. OD 302025597282525300i placed this order on 8th for a laptop and i paid in advance INR 30600 because you promised to deliver it by 12th. i bought this as a valentine gift for 14th.till 12th, everything was normal but when i did not receive it by evening, i called from my side to your customer care, i was told that i will receive it by 7 pm that day only.when i did not receive it , i called again in the night and then i was told it was not despatched even from delhi and got a promise that i shall get it by 15th in any case.very strange nobody from your side bothered to call me to update on this before.i kept on calling and mailing but nobody responded in a responsible manner.everybody was telling me stories about your courier partner. why the hell should i know about your relations with your courier partner. i know and i paid to flipkart for a service which you failed in all senses. on 14th, evening when i was thinking i am about to receive my gift, i got a call first time from your side that i will not be getting it by tomorrow even. and i shall be receiving it by next week.what a team and what a service you are offering to a customer who has paid you 30 k in advance.when i asked him to cancel the order in anger, he was happily and quickly ready to do so, it seems you wanted me to cancel the order because of some odd reason may be product stock out or non viable, strange! he did not ask me once to reconsider my decision of cancellation. and i restrained myself from canceling the order intentionally.i am deeply hurt on emotional level and financial also to a bit. i have all the reasons to pull your management to consumer court and teach a lesson on what a customer is.very annoyed!!

Sir,     Subject: Return request received for Items in Flipkart Order - OD301300753257402200 This mail is regarding aforesaid order of KENSTAR OXYFRYER for which I had requested an exchange. Despite my repeated requests and phonecalls I am not getting any response from you. For your information I bought this product on 17th Nov,2014 and return request was sent to you 13th Dec,2014 i.e. within one month. your technician visited my place to check the appliance on 17thDec,2014 and confirmed the fault in texture of product. Since then this issue is just lingering on. I have got calls for pick up and new delivery almost thrice but of no result. Of late I receive only false assurances of a call back to resolve the issue whenever I call.   I am sorry to inform you that I have not received any call from your office after 31st Jan,2015. I am a very old customers who have been ordering from you almost on routine basis and look at the way you are attending to my complaint. A company like you who has been propagating and selling products under ONE MONTH EXCHANGE POLICY is not exchanging even a faulty product is something very shameful.               I now request you to exchange the product immediately.Aditij Dhamija9811167322
Hello,  It has been 4 days, since I requested for item return and want my money in my wallet. But I am not getting any satisfactorily reply from customer service guys. Today when I called customer service they assured me that item will be picked today and once everything verified Flipkart will initiate refund. Day is almost completed but no one has called me for collection. Is this is Flipkart service ? I believe that Flipkart is genuine towards their customers, but sorry to say that its service is declining. Please help me as soon as possible.  My order number- OD002040608813182500. I have been asked that a collection person will come on Saturday (14-Feb) and pick your item but no one has call me or come to pick an item. Today is Monday 16-Feb, please send the person to collect item and initiate my refund.  Regards, Ashish S (09324386623)

Hi   I ordered a nokia bh 310 Bluetooth headset from your site for which was delivered today but the headset is not charging ... their is no light coming on when connected directly and when connected through car charger the light keeps on blinking but the headset doesn't charge... if possible, I would like to have it replaced and if not possible I would need a refund.    I tried using the refund option on your site as well as tried talking to the customer care executive but due to the glitch on the website they couldn't process the refund and asked me to mail to the customer care     The following are my bank details Bank - Corporation Bank Branch - Dahisar East City - Mumbai  IFSC CODE - CORP0000497 ACCOUNT NUMBER - 049700101026012 ACCOUNT HOLDER - Ankit H Mehta    Thanks  regards,   Sent from Windows Mail

Hey,Â  Â  Â  Â This is to inform you that I (Siddharth Bhutra) had placed an order for the Moto X (2nd Generation) Black on the 15th of February with Order No.OD002085779081527300 delivery of which was received by me today ie. 18th February. My registered Mobile No. is 8100693392 and my Email Id isÂ siddharthbhutra@yahoo.com. I was eligible for a Moto Deck Bluetooth Speaker (Lemon Lime) worth Rs. 8990 as per the order summary but unfortunately I haven't received the same with the delivery of the phone. I would also like to bring to your kind notice that I wasn't satisfied with the Ekart service provided while delivering the phone. The delivery person was an hour late than the time which he had provided me with. He wasn't picking up the phone when I had called (20-25 calls was made by me, all went unanswered). After an hour, the delivery person finally called and was asking me to come to a place where he was instead of coming to my place and delivering the product.Â  Â  Â  Â I would like Flipkart to look into the matter and ensure that the freebie of Moto Deck (Lemon Lime) which i am eligible to is dispatched as soon as possible and ensure that the Ekart service is improved. Hope to hear from you at your earliest with a response to the above mentioned query.Thank You,Siddharth Bhutra+918100693392

dear flipkart, i have purchased a moto g 2 second gen from u i have ordered it on 13 jan 2015 but i got it on 20 jan 2015 . from that moment my brother and i have facing the problem of power in this cell. i have called u one time regarding the problem so that u have sent us a moto g service man via door step service.but he was not for the replacement but only for service and i m feeling very angry to report that teh service was not successful. then i have called ur executive again after 12feb 2015 .and again requested to replace this cell or give me my refund .so that i have talked a lady on the customer care service and she assured me that he registered my issue again and the executive from technical department will call me again before the the time limit for replacement is over. i m waiting till then but no call is being recieved .its 17 feb today when i have called ur cs again about the replacement issue but they are telling me that thier is nothing they can do now. tthe time limit for replacment is over . even so they are telling me that there is no record of customer care call for me after 12 feb . but i have got call from ur customer care executive 2 times. its totally and illegly a fruad case. u r playing a fruad with me . how could it be possible when i have called ur cs two times and now they are telling me there is no record of any call. u r not replacing my defective cell worth 12999. then its seriouslly a direct fruad. now ur executive is telling me to go to moto g service center for this issue . how could u do that? how easily u denied that u will not replace  my defective cell. then .. i m warning u sir ji .. i will ban u from my online shopping list and i will tell all my friends and followers to not use flipkart again. i m doing online shopping not only for me but for my friends also . if u will not give me the proper replacement for my defective piece then i will raise this issue to social media or if needed then i will go to consumer court. i m waiting for my reply . call me on 8800935392 . i dont like ur behaviour . i promise i will never make again a single purchase from u . even if  i m a single customer but still my value is more than one .i m waiting for  ur reply. make sure u will call me for solving my issue not for any other stupid reason .

Dear Sir,I had ordered haroad official slip Â on 26.01.2015 as per order No.Â OD201914939524570100. Â I have received the same but Â the size of shoe was not fit Â for me. Hence I requested to exchange the same. My requested was accepted and expected delivery date is given 14 feberuary 2015. But till date I have not received the same. I contacted your customer support at Phone No. 01246150000 on 16.02.2015. They informed thatÂ Â exchange is cancelled as address could not be located. However earlier order your delivery man delivered at the same address.I am working in canara bank branch office Nawada fatehpur Â Teh_ Manesar Distt Guragaon Pin-122004 and the same address is given to you for delivery. Â Every body knows this branch in the location. Â Being reputed government Â bank in india, Â A lot of letters/ items are Â being delivered by the various Â courier agencies every day. but it is surprising that your delivery man could neither locate the address nor call me. However earlier order you have delivered at the same address. I have also purchase many items from Home Shop18 and received delivery at the same address before 7 days.I request you to look into the matter and do the needful for further relationship.RegardsShravan KumarMob 9467324948.

Hi, this is Arun. Yesterday, I booked orders for a DLINK Modem+router costing Rs.1540 and a book costing Rs.118. I booked this order by calling at the customer care service of flipcart. But your representative made some mistake while writing the address, he wrote my house no 75/2 instead of 7/2. When I received the confirmation mail from flipcart, I noticed the wrong address. Then I again called the customer care, then yr representative told that he will cancel my previous order and book it once again.     Currently my order ids are OD102086975048380100 and OD102086975048380101. Please start the process as early as possible.If possible please change the Name in my order to Arun from Arjun, yr reprentative wrote it wrong. If it is shipped then there is no problem, I'll accept it.  Order Id cancelled by me-OD302086836669168801 and OD302086836669168800.  I hope I'll receive my order on time.

Hi Team FlipkartI would like to appreciate your hard work to maintaining good relationshipwith your customers.I always suggest my friends to buy products only from Flipkart, and alsobought many products from Flipkart all are genuine products.Recently I have purchased One Item (Order ID: OD201885201106851201) Moto G2 Generation Smart Phone from Flipkart I was really happy Discount price onMoto G2G.Unfortunately I have received defective product (Issue with power socket),I have raised a request for replacement and replacement request has beenapproved seriously I should appreciate services from Flipkart.Finally I have received a new product from Flipkart I am happy with thatbut this time they disappointed by sending again one more defective product.The product I have received under replacement is completely not workingposition that time I was angry on Seller for sending this type of products.I have tried with different methods to power on the device and tried toreboot the device but I couldn’t able to do that.Finally again I have approached your customer care executive to escalatethe issue.Next day Morning around 11:30 PM I have received a call from one of yourproduct specialist to resolve the issue.I have tried to explain the issue but she was not yet understands the issueand also she was rejected replacement and forced me to take refund.She also said me to visit Motorola service center to make repair theDevice, Here I have one doubt Why should I went Motorola service center forrepair the mobile I have received from seller is completely not workingcondition.Seller should take responsibility about this issue and also product isunder 30days replacement warranty I said the same thing to her.I was seriously not happy with her behavior and way of explanation of yourexecutive.Finally she was forced approved refund for Refund, but I don’t want refund,because I have bought this device with 10% Discount Offer(12999*90/100=11699) Final price is 11699.If I want buy the same mobile again I have to spend 12999 here I am losing1300/- on this device .And also I have spent my valuable time to purchase this item.I am kindly requesting you please replace a new Moto G 2 Generation Mobilewith this defective device and also cancel refund.I believe team Filpkart will maintain valuable relationship with everycostumer who purchased items from Flipkart.Here I am Enclosing screenshots of Mobile this not working condition.I hope I will get positive response from Team Flipkart.Thanks youVamshiDhar Reddy

Hi Flipkart,  Totally irritated/ disappointed feel like fool to have transacted with flipkart.  Item bought - Professional 2ProffAsusZen5sg Privacy Screen Guard for Asus Zenfone 5  Please refund full amount as I had decided i willnot buy anything from flipkart going forward.  problems with Flipkart,these accusations are evident from the below points mentioned under  seller problems.  1. Flipkart does not check its sellers. 2. Flipkart does not do surprise product checking/ seller audits. 3. Flipkart does not even check if the  brand mentioned by seller  actually exist or not. 5. Flipkart helps crooks and fraudsters use its brand/ website for a commission / cut in the  fraud earnings.  6.Flipkart has invented the grand idea of by just maintaining a website and enabling a payment  gateway  one can become a e-commerce venture giant. If that is the case then what lesson will  you learn from the failures of rediff shopping/e-bay and other small time shopping websites.E  bay is not trusted by many people for fear of stolen products.  7.Even tele shopping networks and naaptol.com controls the items being sold through their  websites.But flipkart does not have any control.  seller - ShivJiSalesCorp( images attached )   Problems with sellers:  1.The item brand name is professional something -- but i received the item in the package of  skyy platinum  2.The item is cheap china screen guard available in metro stations bus stands for rs.10 per  screen guard.  3.The courier package is sealed inside the courier package the screen guard pack is not  sealed.That means the crook seller has used empty wrapper of some other brand and kept the fake  screen guard inside it.  4.The screen guard was not cut properly to the phone specifications asus zenfone 5 .   5.The screen guard is not privacy screen guard.  with regards,  Vijaya sankar ss chenna

I am very sorry to say that I do not like the material and colour of Â the Toteteca top shoulder bag which was delivered.It looks shabby .Please do the needful so that I can return it.kindly arrange the refund.Sent from Samsung Mobil
Dear Sir/Madam,I am writing despite being assured that the item would be returned and money refunded. If this will help your organisation then be it. I had initially placed an order for a full sleeve jacket by free culture and was sent a sleeve less one. When I checked the flip kart portal it was cheaper. I asked the item to be returned and a new sleeveless at the new rate be provided. Flip kart did the same but this time gave me a product that is defected because the zip does not work. End conclusion on my side is that some one should be responsible for a mistake twice. Either flipkart or free culture. I only pay flipkart therefore, my association is with them and such attitude on my part will force me to show loyalty to the one that is most professional. If this makes sense then make changes in the way you do your business.Thanking you Deepak Mehta9818408829Sent from my iPhone

INCORRECT PRODUCT SENT AGAIN: This is the second instance that the product ordered has been wrongly delivered. The product shown on your site for code: F8J090bt04-BLK Car Charger - the product picture and description show that this is compatible for iPhone 5 as well. But if you look at product box it clearly shows Samsung, HTC etc. Clearly your photoshoot+upload process+product attributes have a mismatch! When I called customer support the person could not find the IFSC code I provided. So really bad experience.... With increasing volumes you are loosing on your quality control of backend channel integration !!! Do something about it!  I tried filling up form for refund of my money but seems your system is not recognizing the IFSC code. I double checked with the bank and they confirmed it is correct . Here are the details: Bank Name: Royal Bank of Scotland N.VAddress - Ocean Heights, K-4, Sector-18, NOIDA - 201301A/C number: 1187043Name: Prashant JainIFSC Code: ABNA0100336 Mobile : 9810625183LL: 01142444761 Let me know if you need more help!

I ordered Huawei honor holly from Flipkart and I have an issue with it. The product which I received opens the task manager by long pressing the menu key.

Dear Customer care, I just want to inform that I am not satisfied with services provided by flipkart.     - Order id-OD001748249713026803(leather jacket). The quality of the    material is very poor. In fact when I received the item, it was already    discolored at two places around the collar.  ## please check the attached photo to have a look.  Order Id-OD001748249713026800 (a saree). On website I selected red color. But when I received the item it wasn't red. It was *Carmine color.*  I understand that u give option to change the item after receiving it. My problem is that I stay abroad (in South Africa) and I told someone else to pick my items from New Delhi. So, I cant return/change the product even if I am not satisfied.  I will never suggest anyone to buy product from flipkart. Your courier system is also not 100% under control. As a customer I don't have anything to do with the supplier of the item. It is supposed to be flipkart sole responsibility about delivery or any issues regarding any order. For your reference you must see the *Jabong *order n delivery systems. Its convenient to track any items delivery online.  I would to love to hear any clarification from your side.  Thank You.     --  With Regards:-  *Kavita Kriti Anand* SAP B1 , Support HP Mail: kavitakritianand@gmail.com contact- +91-9312969747, 971613915

Hello, I am shocked to see that after 15 days of your confirmation i have not received any refund in my account, All account details were given almost 20 days back and 15 days back you confirmed that i will get refund in next 8 working days. How long you will take to refund my money, and stop exploiting me. For your kind information no body has come to pick any jacket and no call has come to me as well, don't give any false statement. In case i don't get refund in next one week i will go to consumer court against you. Warm Regards Deepak Narang Ph.

I think it won't be appropriate to explain same issue again and again because flipakt will what they have to do...despite my several and timely humble request you credited the amount in my wallet and I was the only one who was baging yes I mean baging to you that please do not credit this amount into my wallet because I need replacement not the amount...flipkart you hurt me a lot you people also assured me for not crediting the amount into my wallet and will replace whenever it will came in stock. Yes made the commitment for that you can check the history... There is a lot of words are boiling in my heart but I doesn't affect you at all...there is one thing has been left behind by flipkart and that is disappointment and disappointment....as you people asked me to let you know when the product available in stock which was totally your job but I keep visiting your website and called you that this product is available in morning and also asked not to credit money into my wallet. Think about  your 100% customer satisfaction tag line flipkart. You may contact me on this number 9812242477 to hear disappointed heart live. But I don't think my words and disappointment are  going to bother you. Anyway thank you.
