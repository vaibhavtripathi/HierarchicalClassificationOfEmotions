Sir, I have ordered one Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG phone through flip kart. I requested replacement for the same because of battery problems. And i got a replacement too. when i requested for replacement again your executive called me and suggested me to go to a servicing center and he SAID me that I will get replacement if it too didnt work. Now when I try for refund there was no such option for refund or replacement. When i contacted your customer care center your executives are telling me that the refund can not be given because 30 days expired. It is because of your executive who has misguided me. So in this case Please let me know how to get the refund. And I expect a fast replay from your side.  Regards,      [image: Emoji]  *Renjith P Soman 
Very much disappointments from flipkart team.  Actually i was book one case cover for Samsung galaxy note3. Same image you  will find in attachments . Its clearly shows tht case will be sensor cover  as per your image. But when i received your case today there is no sensor.  Bcz of sensor only i was booked the case. When i was call on your customer  care no. 18002089898 some lady who was attends my call she told me tht  cover neither replaced with other cover or neither refundable. This is  totally cheat with me . When the images clear shows tht this is sensor  cover but in reality this is not. I was requested her tgt plz return this  cover and guve me my money back to me or second option plz replaced this  current cover with some other case . Your department was told me both the  option not avilable. Bcz of sensor cover i was spend this much amount.   Very very very bad experience.  I will never buy from flipkart in future.  Also i post this mail to many of other social media. Please at least rep of this mail and help me. On 10 Feb 2015 13:22, "Flipkart Customer Support"

Hi, As mentioned several times earlier I did receive the product on 13th Feb, but the product was a CLEAR DUPLICATE and looked USED. The same has been confirmed by your team. Please look into the issue in detail before you ask me to keep repeating my statements. That would save both our time which could be used more productively to resolve this issue. In case you are incapable to find the mails please let me know I will send them again.But please do not bother me with half info from your end. To repeat again I want to know the status of the replacement delivery expected on 15th Feb.Otherwise the refund status of the order as I will not accept the product after 15th Feb. I have also got an email regarding the closure of an incident(150215-014593).NOTHING HAS BEEN RESOLVED YET as per my knowledge. Regards, Dipankar

So, that's all? Considering I've wasted my time and money and trusted you again. And, I'm still without a headphone. Honestly, that's a very standard, dry and template based response and it definitely doesn't resolve my problem. I want some action and not your reply about the timescale when my money will be refunded. You shouldn't have taken it IN THE FIRST PLACE when you didn't give me ANYTHING. I WANT A SOLUTION!!!!!!!!

Dear Flipkart,This refers to the order id OD301967379382482800. This order was placed for 3 killer vest packs of XL size. However, Flipkart made a mistake on one pack, which contained M size. Rest of the two packs contained XL size and were okay. On the pack that contained M size, there's a sticker on the pack stating XL, but it's visible from outside that the vest is M as printed on the vest. I am attaching a photograph of the pack, which shows the external sticker of XL and if you zoom the picture, it shows M size printed on the vest by the company Killer.I have called the call center twice. Last week the representative promised that I will get the refund but I didn't get any intimation. This week again I called and explained the entire story but the representative said as per policy Flipkart cannot refund the money since it's a inner wear. While I fully understand the policy, but why should a customer suffer due to wrong shipment. I have been a regular customer of Flipkart but I feel cheated by Flipkart this time. I have not even opened this pack because the real size is visible from outside the pack itself. You can see it yourself from the photo attached. Please let Mr know how should I proceed.ThanksVineet Singhal+91 971758666

Hi,  I am Venkatasubramaniyam. My E-Mail ID is pvenkat84@gmail.com. My order ID is OD002035171047382500. I have booked ASUS Zenfone - 5 on 9th Feb 2015 against this mentioned order ID (OD002035171047382500). I have received the mobile from your flipkart executive on 11th Feb 2015 by 5.30PM. After receiving the mobile i found that there is some fault in the display. So i raised the return request immediately on 12th feb 2015 (The very next day itself) mentioning that there is some display problem in the mobile. Your customer support team has send me a message mentioning that flipkart specalist will call me on 13th Fen 2015 at 12.00PM. An Specialist from flipkart has called me on 13th Feb 2015 by 12.00PM and provided me a troubleshooting method. Adding to that he told me that if it doesn't works we will take the mobile back and replace with a new one. i tried the troubleshooting method but it doesnot works so i again i raised a return request on the same day by 5.45PM. Agianst the second return request i received a call from your specialist team on 14th feb 2015 by 3.00PM. But he didn't give me any solution for this problem. Till now i didnt receive any solution for this problem.  You should understand first i have raised the return request immediately the next day i received the mobile that too because of the display problem only. Adding to this i am not asking you to return me my money back or not asking you some other brand mobile as a replacement. I am asking a new piece of ASUS zenfone-5 only as a replacement since this mobile is defective piece. Please understand the value of 8K is a huge amount for me. If it is some other problem i can tolerate. But it is display problem. Each and everytime if see this display i got irritated. Please understand the customers situation and try to resolve this issue as soon as possible.   Thanks & Regards,  P. Venkatasubramnaiyam Mob: +91-9789087813

h gud afternoon sir mam i recently placed order of remington nose ear and eyebrow hair trimmer for men women
the product I have received is not as shown in the picture how can you beso unfair an can't bias on the basis of colourthe colour I have received is navy blue and the one I ordered was whitecolourthis is really a bad service I never expected this from your teambeing a regular customernow we think that we need to cancel the products have ordered and are aboutto comebecause your service is getting really poor.I can even send you images of this too and why me always can I know
Hi Flipkart Team,Could you please give me an explanation for the same.I don't understand why this order got cancelled without a prior intimationto the customer!!!!!!!!!To be very frank.,its seems very strange and shameful of yourorganisation!!!!I got a call from Flipkart(that too system generated....understood from themessage I got after it.,that it was from Flipkart).I called back to thenumber given in that message.Automatic reply was it will be deliveredtomorrow.Now I am getting a mail saying it got cancelled.I am doing online shopping for the past two years from various onlinestores.But this is the worst experience I had been through.And I was trusting Flipkart very much.But hereafter.,I feel I have torethink while ordering from Flipkart.Why should I unnecessarily waste timebrowsing and selecting items from your store that can end up like this!!I feel the order got cancelled maybe/mostly because the stock was over.Ifthat is the case.,have a proper account of everything before it beingdisplayed to the public.Why do you want us to waste our time browsing allthose and ordering and finally ending up unsatisfied and with a negativeimpression!!!!Please reply me asap with the proper reasons.Also hoping there will be asystem to revert it if the cancellation was not due to shortage in stocks!!!!Hope this will be taken in a positive way..Hoping for a great change onthis system!!Thanks,Aary
Dear Team,I've raised return request got captured under Replacement (Return ID:14282374) - *REQUESTED* as there was no option of selecting return product.My USB 3G card (Micromax MMX337G) is not getting detected by the product ipurchased. I wrote to TP Link technical team and they confirmed on mail(available in trail) that purchased product is not compatible with my USBdevice whereas no such disclosure of selected USB was mentioned either onyour sale page or on product description. This new product is of no use tome hence i request you to refund my amount. Since there is no option of"refund" in second part of request return, i've selecting the only optionavailable "return" but i want my return this product and want my amountback.Request you to look into the same.Regards,Siddharth979301220
Hello,I don't know how the request has been closed. I was just asked to Perform some steps which I told that I will be able to do only at night as new handset was currently not with me. So I even asked for a call back tomorrow afternoon which your person refused. I was asked to raise a fresh request.Shocked to see this mail where you have gone a step ahead to close this request.Would like to hear call recording for confirmation.Regards,Santosh-----Original Message-----From:

I am very disappointed with the service of Flipkart. I had ordered Miss Rose pearl eye shadow palette from Flipkart (see below mail for order details) but what I received was the matte eye shadow palette. This was the first time I ever ordered from Flipkart and has been a disappointment though the other 2 products I received are alright. This not being my fault, I have to go through a very long procedure of refund wherein I have to send you guys some declaration form and photo id proof stating that the name on my account (my maiden name) is my account coz I don't  have an account on my post marriage name, as registered with Flipkart, which makes no sense to me. If the account details are coming from my end, it has to be my account. I hope you guys don't  expect me to open a new account for all such transactions. Usually I get the money back in cash from other online sites from where I order and return the stuff.

Sir/Madam I want to lodge a complaint against the delivery boy against my order numbers OD302043430892667700 OD302043430892667701 OD302043430892667702 as I am a working lady I gave instructions to the delivery boy to delivery the items only after 4pm as they would be no one to collect the order. But your delivery boy failed to turn up on the instructed time instead I started getting messages stating that ' we couldn't complete your delivery today. We will cal you shortly to provide further assistance' I tried to call on the delivery  boy's number which flashed on my truecaller after getting this message on the second consecutive day without any phone call from this particular agency but unfortunately and sadly nobody picked my call. I got worried about the status of order and checked the status by sending a mail to you from your site and came to know that my order has been requested to cancel. This is so untrue as I was so much looking forward to my favourite perfumes and the main attraction was good schemes on them. I don't want to loose on my order as it is not a mistake of mine. Please is it possible that you take an action against your delivering agency and resend my order... Looking forward for a positive response as I am using your website for the first time and don't want to be disheartened or carry a bad impression. Regards Akanksha Bedi

Hello Team,   It's reg the order of Tempered Glass for HTC 820 which I made on 7th February.  It was supposed to be delivered by ekart logistics on February 9th. But till date I haven't received it.  The executive named Murali C(09940251208)  was the point of contact for delivering the product.  But unfortunately I am having bitter experiences. Not delivering in the time in which he was  mentioning or was supposed to .  Not making any attempts to deliver the product and sending the message stating that delivery unsuccessful.  While I reached out to him for this message the comment which I got is "As its a holiday I thought you won't be coming to office".  Before sending the unsuccessful deliver at least he should make an attempt to reach out to us.  And I am making it as a last chance of ordering with flipkart.  I have already registered a complaint with flipkart ticketing (150214-087063).  Please do the necessary steps to make your services prompt.   Thanks  Aruna    Aruna Ramesh Smailtoccie@aol.com

Hello Team,This is* really frustrating for me* to get the defective piece again andthis time I am not going to just get it replaced.I just want my money back to my bank account not Flipkart wallet shit andyou have to arrange a pick up this time. I am not going to fight withcourier guys like I did last time and send it back to you guys as they arenot accepting it coz your WS-Retail they don't deliver products over there.I have ordered multiple products before on Flipkart and was happy and loyalcustomer with Flipkart while now this doesn't seems to work as in past Ihave recommended Flipkart to my friends and family also to my officecolleagues but now this seems to come to an end.Hope you understand my frustration and pain.*This was a gift to a family member, and this is what he had received adefective product not once but twice.**Issue with device:* First product which I had received had a batteryproblem i.e., a full charged battery was draining to zero within 10 mins.Somehow I got it replaced though not to forget the pain I had face with thecourier folks to deliver it to you guys.I received the replacement and this time it is not even getting started, itgot stuck up at Welcome screen, nothing is working no matter how many timesI have restarted it.I just want to get my money no replacement this time.Also, to mention I have couple of products inlined which I need to buy bythis week and I was thinking to use flipkart service but now I have to lookfor other options.To give you insight about what is inlined are:2 Ipads2 Case Covers for MacBook pro.2 Apple Magic Mouse2 Wireless keyboard2 laptop hard case cover for travel.There are more orders yet to be made but now I have to look for otheroptions.Regards,Apoor

hi i have ordered blue color shirt as shown in the picture and deliveredwith a green ones very disappointed with the service kindly let me know if you could help me in anyway
Sir,  I am not asking for any refund or exchange. I am requesting you  to provide the fillers, beads as a part of the bean bag that has been bought. That would be appropriate for the incident. You must consider this matter seriously, as it is not our fault as customer.  If you carefully read the link, you will find the following specifications : XXXL, leather, without beans, And BEAD FILLING. How do you think the customer to understand when you have put those specifications? I request you to go through the link again and try to understand what problem the customers have while reading it. Now, I kindly request you to do me justice in this matter by providing the Bead Filling.  Please acknowledge to this mail as this is the second time, I am writing it to you as there was no response. This kind of injustice would definitely hamper you customers and your market. Expecting your mail at the earliest.   Thank You

It looks like the sellers on flipkart are having a free run with what everthey feel like. The product that was off KHI Men's checkered footie sockswith a cumulative MRP of Rs. 656/- for  a pack of 5 socks (attached images)but what was delivered to me from the seller is of very cheap quality andthe quality is such that even roadside vendors would be selling betterproducts. I have attached the images of the product i received and also theMRP of the product delivered to me is of Rs. 59/- each making it acumulative price of Rs. 295 (for the pack of 5) (again images attached withthe MRP highlighted).so it looks like the seller is a cheater, a fraudster and on top of that icalled up flipkart helpline and was told since its a no return item, theyare unable to help me.So being a consumer what should i do. I feel like being cheated not only bythat seller but also by flipkart and if i dont get the item that wasdisplayed then i think flipkart is also hand in glove with the seller incheating the consumers.A very disappointed and unhappy consumer with the lack luster attitude offlipkart consumer care

hi i did have more transactions in my account so i just want to make sure that my refund get processed or not for the boots thanks
Dear Sir/Madam,It gives me immense pain and a feeling of being betrayed  by your esteemedcompany Flipkart.Please find below the mail I received from Flipkart mentioning thecancellation of my order, when I have not cancelled my order at the firstplace. I placed this order on Feb 2, 2015 and have been eagerly waiting forit to be delivered to my address.I even received a mail from flipkart yesterday mentioning that there willbe a delay in the delivery by 2 more days, yet I was ok with it and waited.How can Flipkart suddenly cancel the order when the shipment has alreadyreached more than halfway?  I am absolutely unsatisfied with thisirresponsible step taken by Flipkart. How do you expect your customers tobe loyal to you when you break their trust in this way?Thankyou so much for all the incovenience and dissatisfaction that youcaused,Unsatisfied yet, Loyal customer,Monojit Paul

I am writing to complain about the poor service i received twice from flipkart.Im really upset with the service of flipkart. I ordered moto g2. And i received a defective product. I was worried and called upon the customer care. They said they would replace the product. And the second time too i received a defective product. The power button was damaged and malfunctioning,Sim card slot 1 was not working. I really think that the product received is genuine product or not. This is really annoying to receive defective and damaged products twice. I'm really fed up with flipkart service. This time i need a proper replacement with some vouchers. I demand freebies or vouchers for the disappointment from your service.  My order id : OD201880584190376201 Contact : 9600140707

HI Flipkart Team, I have tried the troubleshooting steps that were provided to me in the previous mail several times but havent been able to go beyond step 5. In Step 4, I do get the 'Android in distress' symbol with a 'No comand' text below it. But no matter what I do I am unable to reach Step 7 to the WIPE DATA / FACTORY RESET option. I went ahead with the alternate option of Factory data reset within the Backup and reset section in the Mobile settings but nothing has improved so far. I am still facing network connectivity issue with the Moto G 2nd Gen phone that I purchased from Flipkart. The network signal dies off suddenly at times and doesnt work at the time I need it the most. I have faced problems with this phone on numerous occasions and I would request you to kindly replace the phone at the earliest. I am really hoping that the new phone that you provide, works the way it is supposed to. As per the details I mentioned earlier in this mail chain, Motorola majorly has connectivity issues with Moto G phones starting with IMEI nos. 3533. Request you to take this into account when you provide me with a new phone as part of the replacement policy. I do not want to end up with a faulty phone again. I would also like to know that the replacement policy and warranty period still remains intact on the new phone that you will provide starting from the date you deliver it to me? Thanks, Abhinab

Hi Team,  I ordered a Baggit Belt, Order No OD302075519574854701, but it has been returned for some unknown reason.  I am a Flipkart First customer and i expected 1 day delivery of the WS retail product. I appreciate that 180 rs has been added to my wallet as refund. But, the order has not only been delayed, it has been now returned due to some fault at your logistics end.  I paid for Flipkart First subscription to get the best service and my products on time and I had faith in you guys. More than being angry, I am disappointed that if you handle Flipkart First customers like this, then how will you handle the normal ones. I need my money's worth what I paid for being a Priority Customer.  I have shopped a lot on Flipkart, I trust your brand name and I hope this will not be repeated again. Hope to hear back from you!  Regards, Tapish Gupta

Hi,  I want to give feedback for my above order regarding the gift wrap I have opted.  I have paid Rs.30 for gift wrap but the wraping what I have I have received will cost maximum Rs.5. Only a normal wraping paper is used which we can get in market in Rs.5.  I was feeling assamed while gifting with such kind of wraping.  I am shopping in flipkart since past 3 years, but its first time I am disapponted after shopping due to this cheap quality of gift wrapping.  I request you to provide sample picture of gift wrap while placing order, so that in future other customers will not feel disapponted after paying Rs. 30 or please do not charge this much amount for wrapping.

This mail is in reference to Order Id OD201824869630450400. I called a couple of times to your customer service helpline but still haven't got a feasible solution.    I received a pair of earphones which were not original and now is not working. Flipkart claims to sell 100% genuine products, but the trust was broken.  As the product is not genuine, the Nokia Care won't change the product for a new one, neither Flipkart is sending a new one. I am stick with a tantamount product.  Flipkart is not supposed to function like this. Highly Disappointed.  If this still continues, I will take a strict action against Flipkart. --  Rahul kumar

Dear Sir/Madam, My name is Ahmad and I'm from Budgam district of J&K state (Kashmir Province). I'm glad and satisfied to have flipkart in my country that trustworthy. I've received many a products from it. But the shameful thing always for me has been that I never hve been able to receive them at my destination but have to travel long long way to other areas for same. My area pin code is 193401 that I've several times requested you to recognize unfortunately you didn't care. I assure you there are hundreds of customers in my area interested in flipkart and your belief. Once you add to your coverage it will be very blissful for customers and flipkart too. More to it I request you to facilitate if not 100% but at least 50% of your available products. All the time I can see some mobile phones and a few tablets are shippable to Capital here called Srinagar and nothing more. Please admit that people in here wish you good and want from you good. Regards.
hi the mobile cover is small for my phone it is not for a samsung kindly see what can be done regardsmalika abichandanion jan flipkart com

Hello,  I bought a Moto E from Flipkart, which was delivered on 28th January 2015,for Rs 6999/- Later i found out that it has issue with its display. The display used to go out randomly and used come back. However the phone was actually useless to me as the display used to stop working anytime. I requested for replacement of this product and a fresh piece got delivered to me on 17th February 2015. For now this new Moto E appears to working fine.  Meanwhile Flipkart announced a new price for Moto E (Rs 5999/-)  Shouldn't I have waited for 2 more weeks to get a discount of Rs 1000/- because in spite of buying the product on 28th January 2015, it was actually usable on 17th February 2015 due to a defect in product.  Considering this a special case and going by my loyalty to Flipkart, I am requesting either a cashback of Rs 1000/- or a gift voucher of the same amount from Flipkart.  Please read above text again to know the gravity of this request.  --  Thanks, Kedar Joglekar 9890873622
dears thanks for the reply please note that i need the product before feb th because i am orderedth product remotely outside india and wife will be collecting from thegiven address and she will be travelling back to my place also i was purchased this item on jan or like that but u didnotapproved the order till jan so kindly request the shipp the item as soon as possible regards
I have still not received the refund. Pathetic service. First, the customer service rep was insistent that the money was refunded, but when I continued to deny, he reluctantly agreed to check and, of course, it was not refunded. Amazon seems much better at keeping customers happy rather than Flipkart which is now trying its best to reach new lows in customer satisfaction. Come on, ultimately, it is my money that you are playing with. If you have not been able to deliver my product in good shape in *TWO* attempts, it is *NOT* my fault.

I am writing this email in regards to the Order # OD302058081630504100which was delivered to me recently.I would like to mention that the quality of this product [ Phone cover forGoogle nexus 4] was so poor that i cant even look at it. For â¹ 199 , i dontthink it was worth of.Adding more to my sadness and aggravation, the cover was not even fittingon the my phone.I have requested return of this product, but there was no option to refundof money! The only option was replacement of that product. I am sorry but ican take another cover of same quality or same vendor who is just sendingthe wrong and sub par quality products.Please arrange the pick up of this product and do not replace it. As thiswas COD, so return my money to my flipkart account, as i will use thiscredit to buy the cover from some better vendor.This was seriously a ridiculous product.Get back to me ASAP.Regards,Kuldeep SisodiaE-mail : lomaxomatic@gmail.comTwitter : kuldeeps_Phone: +91-9928006113

Respected Sir / Madam,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  With regards I would like to state that the delivery of my order NoÂ OD302022021776316000 was supposed to be done today. But as yet the delivery has yet not been completed. I request You to kindly change your logistics Courier Partner. Because Not only are they rude in their behaviour but also fail to do their services properly. Shopping from your site is really a great experience but to your courier partner's behaviour I refrain shopping from your site. I called to two of the Courier guys & it appeared as if they were lying. But of them replied that they are on leave. Please Check whether Employee Rajeev Prasad as well as Mr. Pradeep Kumar with Mobile No's 09643304127 & 08588895310 with Ekart logistics were on leave on 16th february 2015 or not. Because I personally called them up & inquired about my product's delivery & both of them said that they were on leave. Specially I would like to mention about Mr. Pradeep Kumar that I called him up 15-16 times, not only did he lie about his supervisor's No, but also after 2-3 calls didn't receive my phone. I am sorry to say with this kind of courier partners you would soon be leaving your Customer Base in this area. I Sincerely hope that you would look into the matter & would take some stern action against the erring employees. My Duty was to bring this issue to your Notice or else some Customer would one day some Customer of yours would be forced to Complaint either with FIR( First Information Report ) or in the Consumer Complaint Cell seriously about these employees in the coming Future. My suggestion to you is to kindly get these employees reprimanded or to serve them with a strict warning as soon as possible. Kindly Update me at the earliest about the delivery of my consignment for order NoÂ OD302022021776316000.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  I would be extremely greatful to you.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Thanking You,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Vatsalya Gupta,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Date: - 16/02/2015
Hello,  Here, I want to complain about Flipkart's inefficient courier service. A  friend of mine, who lives in Chennai, had ordered a book, named 'To Kill  a Mockingbird', for me on 9th February, 2015. She had provided my mobile  number and delivery address (Anand, Gujarat). At that time, I had got  the message telling that my order had been shipped, but yesterday, I  received another message from Flipkart telling that their courier  partner had been unable to deliver the item.  When I called Flipkart's  customer support, they told me that the order was cancelled by the  seller. Just like that, just snap......closed. They didn't even bother  to correct their mistake. That's how Flipkart treats its customers?  Avoids their complaints by giving excuses.  This is the reason, I have stopped preferring Filpkart over Amazon. And  that is why, I had told my friend to go for Amazon when she was ordering  the book. But she preferred Flipkart, giving me the reason that we  should encourage an Indian firm, instead of going for Amazon. And this  is how she got treated? Congratulations. You people certainly have lost  one more potential customer.  Another thing. You take a hell of a long delivery time. For your  information, I had ordered the same book, on the same date (9th Feb) on  Amazon to Chennai's delivery address. Amazon got it delivered on 10th  February, the very next day. Of course, you will give an excuse that it  was being delivered to a metro city so it took less time. But all I know  that Amazon wouldn't have taken more than 4 days to deliver it here in  Anand, Gujarat. Flipkart takes it the whole 7 days and on the 8th day,  to my shock, I get a message telling me that the order has been  cancelled. Really?  Now. I hope you won't be so careless to ignore this complaint. Reply to  this, I also need some further assistance from you people.  Order ID : OD102033175713157200  --  Ashish Devre (+91) 9898404734

Dear Flipkart,  I do not understand the problem with this model. During my last interaction with Rahul Bajaj one flipkart's Floor supervisor I experienced a very good customer service with respect to my problem.  I received the replaced Hand Set on 16th- Feb-2015 around 2:00 PM. In order to be sure about the quality and the performance of the handset I did a phone reset first then I started using it. But after using it for almost 36 hours I have witnessed following problems:  1. FM Radio Still turns off when I lock the screen. 2. When I tried to play a few games which required multi-touch. The multi-touch response was very bad. I tried to adjust the sensitivity of the touch but even after the adjustment with the touch the multi-touch problem was there. 3. With the earlier set the camera was good and responsive but in this one the camara is taking ages in opening.  To be honest with you guys. I have never had such a bad experience with any of my phones.  I do not need this phone at all. Please arrange a refund for me.  Regards, Raman Singh 8860638322
extremely sorry for not replyng to the call due to some reasons please go ahead with the order sent via xiaomi flipkart com

Firstly let me make you aware thatinfant products should be most importantly hygienic than any other quality.For this product " Mickey T-Shirt and Trouser set combo" which is orderedby me on 11th of February (OD302047839654546000) and delivered today18-02-2015 please clarify whether it is a brand new product as said in thelisting.Please find the attached photographs of the item delivered by Flipkarttoday. Kindly Zoom in and see whether the baby dress delivered is hygienic.The item is soiled and is having a lot of dirt attached to it. Not on thecover but inside it. How can you decide to sell such crappy filthy item tome as a newborn baby wear?I purchased this item for giving it to a new born baby on my first visit tothe mother and child. Firstly you delayed the shipment and most importantlyyou sold me an item which can't be given to a newborn baby and motherliving in a civilized society.Now I am forced to buy something from the local store and visit the babyand mother.Meanwhile you are requested to justify the reason why such a soiled productto me at the price of brand new item. Also please confirm your course ofaction with respect to my concern.*Thank you.*On 18 February 2015 at 18:52,

I explained that we informed the flipkart that we received wrong product with expected size only..... he simply refuse the pick and told us that how r u so careless that u did not know the issue with ur product and wasting our time by creating wrong complaints....  I need an answer of simple question from u guys that what was my fault >- u delivered me wrong product >- u raised a wrong request >- u refused to pick up product >- u blamed me that i raised a wrong complaint product  means everything was done by you and culprit is me........  the product was with sangeeta and she missed her classes just because of u guys as she got a msg of pick up but ur Courier guy talked in such a bad way that u did not know what exactly is the issue with ur product.... Is this the way treating a woman customer  everything done wrong from ur side and who is suffering .... customer only  never expected such a blonder service from flipkart  worst order management worst customer supports agent  was a mistake from my end that i placed an order from u guys i am disappointed by each department  worst service ever i have seen in my life.....

I have placed return request for this phone. Firstly when i received confirmation call for this return request then your customer executive mentioned wrong reason for return request, i told him that reason is battery Charging and heating issue, your customer executive mentioned battery back up and heating issue. There is difference between battery charging and battery backup. This creates confusion for me and your technical department employee who visited for checking my phone. Secondly, when i have received call from yourÂ  customer care executive then she was trying for convince me to take my return request back irrespective of what she is saying, when i was talking him about my battery issue then she told me at first time that you should not charge your phone in 0 to 5% which can result in problem in battery and when i told him that i always charge phone after 20-25% then she told me what are you saying you should always charge phone from 0 to 5% and when i told him what are you saying you are changing your commentsÂ  then she ignored it.Thirdly, your customer executive has confirmed that i will received call for confirming address and timing for come person from technical department for check my phone and after some time from this call i have received a sms fromÂ  flipkart that my return request disapproved by giving reason that issue has been resolved by communication between customer and seller, how you can lie like that and when i called again flipkart then your another customer care executive told me that he is not able to understand why i have received this sms and one person from technical department will come for check my phone and its request has already been created. Your customer care executive from which i called firstly has created all thisÂ  confusion and problem. It seems like that your customer care executive was trying to ignore my request. I never see this type of service in any website. Your customer care executive cross limits for close my return request. Do you give this type of service to all your customer who place return request. you thought thatÂ  Return request is customer problem, this is not problem of flipkart, flipkart work and responsibility was till only money received. Now this is too much. I want my phone replace fast. I didn't expect this type of service from flipkart. I will never buyÂ  anything or nor recommend anybody to buy anything from flipkart again. I didn't know that flipkart provides this types of services to their customer after money received.

I didn't expect this from FlipKart!The bag I received today was simply wrapped with a thin black plasticpolythene bag with the bill carelessly pasted over it with cellotape. I hadto carefully remove the bill so that its not damaged or torn. Verydisappointed with the kind of packaging, however the product seem to be ingood condition. Flipkart used to pack the products nicely in cartons andboxes and I used to love to open it. This one is highly disappointing. Itsworse packing than SnapDeal :/I'm happy with the product, but not with the packaging!I'm attaching these images for your referenc
Just to confirm, I've been told that my order for the laptop and screen guard will be picked up for return.  Firstly, I dont have the original packaging of the screen guard and the outer package has been torn up. So I'm not sure if it would be accepted for return by the individual.  I then received a call from an ekart executive telling me he is on his way to do the pick up of the items. I told him I have some data on the laptop I need to move first. He told me to inform you guys otherwise no one will come to pick it up the next day. So this is me informing you guys. If anything, you have my phone number to reach me. Feel free to call for any clarifications.

Dear Flipkart     I had put an order , order number : OD102088821196500700 on 16/2/1025 . (on behalf of numrata navada: addresse name)Without no reason whatsover I received a mail on 17/2/2015 stating that a refund had been initiated (again no reason given).On talking on your number with the customers care executive he again confirmed that the order had been cancelled and told me there had been a "technincal" problem. I was told the book is available and I should go and place the order again.Though I was pissed I decided to put the order in again. When I went on the site I found to my dissappointment that the book which I had ordered was out of stock or either the other versions (different retailers) were not in my price range.Clearly, the order seems to have been cancelled wothout giving any reasons whatsover due to the non-availability.It is common decency to not PUT ON DISPAY or place OUT OF STOCK notices on books you don't BEFORE THE CUSTOMER PLACES THE ORDER.also gving a reason rather than a generic "refund processed" is appreciated.Also don't cover your mistakes behind technical errors.If you don't have a book, tell us that is the reason, instead of misguiding us and making us search extensively for an elusive book within our price range which we had ordered before and has now mysteriosly gone out of stock     Quite irritiated  Mansi Gokhale
