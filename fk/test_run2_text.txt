I had registered for the flash sale of MI4 mobile that was going to happen at 2PM on 17/02/15 that is today. I logged into my account much before 2PM and placed the MI4 phone in the cart as soon as sale began. Till then there was no issue. However, next hurdle was to pay for the purchase. I could click the View Cart button but page would not load or if it was loading then it was loading without any graphics. I have attached screenshot of that page herewith. So I called your customer service and talked to one Satyajit well before 2:30PM. I placed the call at 2:08PM. He tried his best to help me by talking to some team in the backend. As per their suggestion, I switched to Chrome Browser and cleared all the cookies etc but the problem would not go away. All this time Satyajit was with me on phone. At 2:25PM, he suggested that I should write to you and attach screenshot of the error page. He was also going to send this feedback to concerned team and he told me that he has noted that I have placed the call well before 2:30PM deadline to complete the purchase.Now I expect your help in completing this purchase.Let me know how to do it asap.Â Â Thanks and Regards,Rajendra DixitGokulam, 11 Manisha Society, Near Alankar Police Chowky, Lane opposite Suvarnarekha Auto Center,Karvenagar, PUNE - 411 052.

Hi, I am one of the most loyal customers of Flipkart. Almost every other day the Ekart delivery guys come home to deliver mostly prepaid goods.This is specially regarding most recent delivery at my doors made by them. I was unavailable to receive the package personally. My father tried receiving it, was refused. He was told he needed me to personally rcv it. Then I made a call on this guy's phone, telling him he can hand it over to my father(he has made several deliveries at my doorstep), he refused. Finally I had to send across my phone to merely have the shipment received! Clearly, this was a trick to trouble me n nothing else; as he could not have identified the source of message as it carried no code or something that exclusive. Please look into the matter. As I have a lot more products in the loop, yet to be delivered.Thank you. Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android
i have returned a product due to some quality reasons but i dont have a back account with my name as i am years old so can i give my father s account for the return payment please helpon feb flipkart com

Please refer to my earlier complaint dated 14.2.2015. In this regard i would like to inform you that your product specialist called me up on14 Feb, around 6:30 PM and asked me to do some settings in the phone and assured me that after doing that problem of my phone will get resolved. I did all the settings as advised by your expert but even after doing everything the problem in my phone is still there. My phone is still getting switched of/rebooted on its own.  To make it worse, the frequency has increased now.  I always rated your website highly probably the best in our country but the kind of response i got from you in respect of this product is disappointing.  Therefore, i once again request you to look into the matter and Replace/exchange this faulty phone at the earliest.  Regards! Sangeeta Mob. 9560703196

Dear Flipkart Team,Please refer to the below email for reference. Please make a note that I have not received any communication from you after the first call where it was told that they will get back to me in 24 hrs. I had again called and spoke to the CS team and they have given another date for response.The Phone was ordered on 20th of January and received on 24th of January by my wife. I have started using this phone from 31st of Jan as I was on travel and came for a day at home. Since then I am facing the issue and it has been informed to you on 10th of Feb.I have also visited the Authorised Xiomi Service Centre in Vashi (207, Vardhaman Market, Opp Andhra Bank, Vashi, Navi Mumbai) however the service centre is shifted to the door nearby and address is not changed in the website. The Service centre person had told that they have not received the original Software from Xiomi and hence they canât take the complain. However they told me there are issues related to software and hardware both exist in the phone and Flipkart should be able to replace and help.The following are the issues related to phone1. It hangs frequently2. Many software (including the softwares provided by the MI)  gives error (refer to the screen shots)3. Frequent disconnection while charging -Hardware issue4. takes 15-20 hrs for full charging5. some time camera hangs6. SD card is not readable using the cable provided - Hardware issue7  Frequent disconnection in WiFi8. and Many more . . .I am not interested to return the product and get a refund and rest assure i have not brought this product for that. I want you to replace the phone with a new phone. Please do the needful at the earliest.Regards,Sujeet Acharya+91 98204 80706     On 10-Feb-2015, at 2:23 pm,

To whomsoever it may concern,I had ordered a variety of bedsheets in the BIG day sale of Oct. 1st. However, not all of them were to my satisfaction. After months of exchanging emails, asking you to take the bedsheets back, a few were taken back. However, the refund was never given. I have given my a/c details, but every time there is an automated response telling me there is a problem with the a/c info i have given. I have checked and double-checked, but there is nothing wrong with it. Sometime later, you have (without my consent) turned these refund amounts to e-vouchers. These products have been sitting with me for the past 3 months.I urge you to take the rest back and refund me the ENTIRE amount. I dont want the e-vouchers.Â Following are the items, which have been returned but their refund amount has been turned into e-vouchers, -Â OD100943080560800400OD000943083595906500Following are the items yet to be returned, -Â OD100942974281956700 OD200943070590877700I repeat, please refund me the entire amount in cash or transfer it into my bank a/c.Following are by bank a/c details, -Â A/c holder's name - Manoj BahetiÂ Bank name - Indian BankÂ Branch - Burra BazarÂ A/c number - 482586855Â IFS Code : IDIB000B034Please get back to me as soon as possible.Thanks,Abhimanyu Baheti

I appreciate checking all the items before the delivery. This is my third dissatisfaction with Flipkart. I am such a personality if any unacceptable thing occurs I will put it on web and widely publicize in the Media. this will be detrimental to your business. This is my warning and I would like you to correct all your mistakes otherwise the repurcusions will be very serious including legal action. I kept all my evidences ready. I appreciate sending my ordered Teddy Bear and also exchanging the blue coloured wrist watch with the black coloured one as ordered.Please call me on 07731944273 for further details.To err is human when erraser aheads the pencil you are over doing it.RegardsDr. Muralidhar Karanam242 C Block, majestic Mansion, Begumpet, Hyderabad-500016  From: cs

dear flipkart customer care executive i had recently placed two orders using cash on delivery option order no benetton sandal rs and order no the end of power to my shock i received messages and emails pertaining to the above mentioned orders regarding order no i was told that i have cancelled the order i haven t cancelled any order and in my house only my parents live so there is also no possibility that the delivery was attempted and they didn t receive also the courier company never called me i was constantly keeping an eye on the order the order no reached the allahabad hub on january but no one ever came and after two days i received an email that my cancellation request has been accepted now when i see the same product it is priced at rs regarding the second order order no the end of power which i ordered for rs i received an sms pointing out that the product has been packed and is ready for shipment but after four days i am being told that due to some reasons the product cannot be delivered and now the same product is priced at rs so if i place an order for either of the two products i will be loosing my money i want to ask why has flipkart started cheating its customer if you check my account you will find that i have been a regular customer of yours and have done huge purchasing from your website it is a pity that a company which has been so reliable has started playing tricks with its customers first you offer discount and once the order is placed you ship the product and when the product is in transit you give a very stupid reason that the cancellation request has been accepted or the item cannot be delivered due to some reasons why do you offer the discounts if you have to play these fraudulent games i want both the products but the price has been raised i shall wait for your reply before lodging an official complaint in a court because i could have purchased the same items at the same through other wesbite during the discount period but now there is no discount regards dr om prakash dwivedieditor jclcell
Dear Flipkart,  This complaint is regarding an automatic cancellation of an order that I had placed on Sunday, Feb 15. Following is the background:  1) I placed the first Order: OD002086034681480600 for the product:     *The Vanca Winter Full Sleeve Solid Women's Non-Quilted Jacket* - This was Red colour. - 1249/- I paid 1186/-     Total order value: 1186/-  I cancelled this order soon the same day since I wanted to avail the benefit of 10% off on HDFC Card for a minimum order value of 1999. After cancelling it, I placed the following order on the same day (Sunday, Feb 15)  2) The second Order: OD102086209291732000 for two products:     *The Vanca Winter Full Sleeve Solid Women's Non-Quilted Jacket* - This was Red colour and same as above - 1249/-. I paid 1067/- and     *The Vanca Winter Full Sleeve Self Design Women's Polar Fleece Jacket* - This was black colour. - 899. I paid 769/-     Total order value: 1836/-  I received a cancellation confirmation of the first order and a refund of Rs.1186/- into my account. However, today, I also received another cancellation confirmation and a refund of Rs.1067/- for the Red jacket in the second order. I never raised a cancellation request. Flipkart has cancelled this on its own! I very much wanted to buy the product. *Why was my order cancelled like this?*  I spoke to one Abhishek at your customer care@ 080 4940 0000 and he mentioned that the order was cancelled by the Vendor directly. Hence my complaint.  I wanted to avail the benefit of 10% off on HDFC card for the total value of 1999 which was available only on Sunday. Now that offer has expired.  Regards,  Deepti 8197689195

Hi,This is regarding incident 150218 - 085301. Before proceeding further letme make sure that this in no way alludes to the interaction or courtesy ofthe customer care representative.                 I think it would be better if the e - gift vouchers arevalid for life time or atleast for a couple of years. One year is too shortin case the fact that we have a voucher just escapes our memory for sometime. I am one such guy who has to suffer from this clause and as a resultloosing â¹500. This is even detrimental to the sales of the e - giftvouchers. Though I am not a management guy to weigh the pros and cons ofsuch a strategy, as an average customer, I feel it's something which needsa careful thought.-- N.S.Vidyaranya,General Secretary - Academic Affairs,IIT Indore.

Hello,  This is Vamshi Krishna S.  I have purchased 'Lenovo A6000' mobile on 4th feb, 2015. But am not at all happy with the product. Am facing issues with battery backup.  Placed request for replacement on 17th feb, 2015. Today I got a message saying they were not able to call me up and asked to call the customer service on toll free number for further assistance regarding the replacement request. I called up the customer care and were given some instructions to trouble shoot the problem but still not able to solve the problem and another problem started i.e. the phone is not at all switching on. The status of the first request regarding the replacement is showing that this has been closed. I raised another request for the replacement stating the recent issue with the phone. I request you to kindly look into this issue and do the needful at the earliest.  There were some problems like the number i call in the lenovo mobile is not able to receive call sometimes even the number is ringing. May be this will be considered as call drop problem.  I want to claim for the replacement of the mobile. We people buy the products only with the trust with your brand expecting a good product always. If this is the service we expect from you people how can we trust you.  please do the needful at the earliest.  Order : OD001990506556562300 (Lenovo A6000) First return request ID: 14392403 Second return request ID: 14459638  Thanks and regards, Vamshi Krishna S 9849997554.

hello i am confirming the order sent from yahoo mail on android
âDear Team,I would like bring this case in your knowledge so that you may help ur team to improve and not making people fool.I bought a product from your website and which was delivered to me on 9th Feb, the product was over sized and was not reasonable in terms of the qualityâ and the amount that I have paid hence I made a return request on 10th Feb and on 11th Feb evening around 7pm I got a call from somebody, he asked whether my office was closed today? I said no, it was opened for the whole day. âAnd then he said mam I was just verifying as his field guy told that the office was closed. Somehow, probably that guy managed to come to pick up the product @ 8.30pm on 11th Feb i.e. wednesday. Now the second story starts, I don't what happened with my product since then as I have not received any confirmation frm flipkart whether they have received my product or not. When I called the customercare on 13th Feb, they said according to their status pickup has not done yet. I called that field boy on the number from he called, he said mam pls make another request again for the pickup as the product was not reached to their warehouse but was there at their hub office since then. I denied them to make another picked request. And when I said I will do an escalation again u and ur team, he said I don't mind pls do it. Then today that means on 15th Feb morning they misused my account details and made another pickup request and after that they have shown that they made a pick today 15th Feb to make u fool whereasthey have already picked it up on 11th Feb from me.  So they are well aware how to make CS deptt and buyer fool.. PFA the acknowledge receipt and take an action against them for misusing my account details.Sent from my BlackBerry 10 smartphone

8Hi,My order was out for delivery yesterday and was not delivered , today again it was out for delivery and i get message from your courier partner that they could not find my address. On calling back to the person he said he has already left and delivery not possible today.After 15 - 20 orders in last 2-3 years from Flipkart delivered to the same address one day suddenly my address can not be found by flipkart.I am having a very bad time with flipkart, my last order was canceled by you now the present order you have not delivered till date, despite "Out for delivery SMS" coming two times.Your policies have also changed , for Flipkart first you have a "next day delivery" for purchases from wsretail, the option "radio mark" did not exist for my last two purchases both for WSRETAIL. If this is the service i am going to get , and if "next day delivery" has been discontinued by flipkart, why i am subscribed to Filpkart first.Please suggest if there is option to opt-out for Flipkart first, and of course my money back.Also i will wait till Sunday if your person can still not find my address , please cancel this order and give me my money back.Regards,Vikas Sharma9899595486Alternate no.  :  9599133652From: no-reply

Hi Sachin,     I just placed and received my order OD002083254596880600 and I am extremely sorry to say that this is my last order with Flipkart.  I have been a loyal Flipkart customer which you can verify from my previous orders but this order has been a very bad experience.     1 hour after I received the iPad Air 2 product I saw an additional offer for 5% discount at your site.   However your customer executive denied me that offer and was told that there are no returns allowed once ordered.     Price adjustment is a normal practice followed in most online sites as well as stores.  I have had no issues in getting credits for price adjustments within a reasonable time frame from other sites like Amazon.in  I am sure 1 hour would sound like a reasonable time frame to you.     Please can you issue me a credit of Rs. 1,795 (5% of Rs. 35,900) otherwise I am afraid this is my last order with Flipkart.     Thanks  Piyush  M +9176812379

For all these happening I had filed a complain and I got refund of only INR 180/- as a token , I hope this is not sufficient amount that can be refunded in this case since I had to cancel my railway reservation and avail extra 10 days leave  on loss of pay. And one more thing is that I have bought this order by my credit card so I have to extra interet without using the mobile for at least 20 days ,So currently I am in loss of around 2700 INR . And the second complain is that since I received my mobile on  09/02/2015 then my warranty period should be covered till 09/02/2016 but in the invoice copy which I got on 17/02/2015 by requesting many times on your voice support service my billing date is mentioned is 31/01/2015 that means my warranty will be covered till 31/01/2016 instead of 09/02/2016 if such case happens I will loss around 9 days warranty cover loss.  So I request to your good office to recalculate the refunded amount and correct my warranty cover problem as soon as possible. I will be highly oblige you if You deal with my problem as soon as possible.  Thanking Toyaj Kumar Pandey Mob no-9807376254

This is to inform you that Mr. Rajeev Prasad with Mobile No: - 09643304127 was completely drunk & seemed quite disrespectful.

I am hereby sending you the images of this courier person so that you yourself can judge the behaviour of his gestures from the images available. I request you to kindly take stringent action against your field executives & should have Customer Satisfaction Survey of the Field Executives as well after the visit to the Customer Place.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  I hope that some appropriate action would be taken soon.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Regards,Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Vatsalya Gupt

Hi,  This is to inform that the Dr. D Leather pouch has just been returned to the courier as discussed due to the poor condition of the cover quality.  The cover has been returned with original packing and was returned since it was hazardous to use since it could lead to possible health ailments like allergy and the artificial leather smelled awful and if used could have led to other health issues and is not at all fit to be used as a cover.  Such a product sold by a vendor must be severely dealt with considering such a poor quality of cover and the seller be strictly banned from selling ahead unless there is a recheck of the quality of products and improvement in them.  Such a poor service is leading the demotion of the Flipkart Brand and ruining customer trust since seems due diligence is not done to perform necessary quality checks.  If you consider that the same is an act of negligence which your teams will once they see and check the product and is a true inconvenience to a genuine customer that penalty must be slapped on seller and an apology credit be also given to me aa customer, with the view that a financial impact on your sellers will make them perform as per the standards set for them.  Your teams have already understood that an apology credit worth Rs. 200/- is a mere acknowledgement towards this low service standard and inconvenience is a mere slap on vendor, but the process binds them.  If at all such acts are not repeated that need to entertain via apology credits will not be needed in future.  In place of denying and committing to an act of apology, work towards reducing such incidents especially with third party vendors.  The cover has been given to courier while now the refund is yet to initiate.  The cover was paid for in cash for the amount of Rs. 345/-  Please initiate a refund for the same in the following account as authorised by me:  Account Holder VINEET DUA  BANK CITIBANK  BANK ACCOUNT NO. 5379161229  Ifsc code CITI0000014  Looking forward to a quick resolution with expedited fund transfer and the due apology credit for the act of negligence in selling a poor quality product and inconvenience caused thereof.  Regards, Chitra Dua
Hi Flipkart Team,  I am writing for the following order that was made by me.  I need a help from you to consider my case as an exception to cater to my problems.  There has been a problem that the person I ordered the phone for is no more now Due to a cardiac attack.  There is no one I can give away such an expensive phone, in which case I wouldnât have come to you with this request.  I request humbly, and on the humanity front if you can consider my case as an exception, and take the phone back.  I am not asking for you to return me my money as refund.  Instead I am fine if you want to transfer the money into my flipkart wallet account or give me a credit note for the same, which I can utilize for my future purchases on flipkart only.  It would be of great help if you consider my case. The Phone is unopened and untouched. It is still unpacked and is a fresh box piece.  I am ready to bear the courier expenses and to any further extent that I can help you with for any of your expenses, I am ready to do.  Please Let me know your conditions and I would look into them.  Also, if you want I can provide you with any details/inputs that you may require from my end to come to any conclusion.  Hoping for a positive reply at the earliest.  Regards, Rajiv Rajani    From:
Sir ,   In the month of June I had ordered two pairs of fila sneaker from my registered id abhishe55555@gmail.com whose order id was OD40623050117 OUT OF which one of them which is FILA CLASSIC SNEAKER Got torned in the month of December.   I know there is no return policy as it has crossed your one month tenure but I still want to make you acquainted with the fact as you boast high of your customer Satisfaction. It is tempting me to feel that it was not an original Fila Sneaker as I can never believe that a brand like Fila will make a Shoe which would not even last for 6 months.   Its up to you what decision you take regarding this mail but its really disappointing from your part as being a regular customer of Flipkart I can never expect such a thing. For your convenience I am attaching the photograph of my shoes.  Warm Regards ABHISHEK MISHR

Hi Team,I received call today from your executive and he said he will offerreplacement only.May I know why?I Paid 4000 rupees extra to get upgraded product from redmi 1s.Why would I accept a product  which is downgraded not even matchingstandard of redmi 1s in terms of display, build quality and camera.If you pay extra on same brand you expect higher end product which isbetter  not downgraded. Redmi note 4G looks cheap and low in quality.Display is shit I  can see pixilation while browsing very well itcanât be HD Display.Camera is not even 2 mega pixel and its mentioned 13 mega pixel.  Howfool do you think people are?Play this marketing tricks with someone else. I will never get into this trap.Donât let me go to technicality of things I can go even deep anddeeper to get the refund done.Would be better for both of us if its get sorted out soon.INITIATE THE REFUND.Regards,Pradeep Chaudhary

Hi FlipkartThank you for the quick delivery of the order. Unfortunately, your servicesdid not meet my expectations.The delivery was accepted in my absence. the worst part about this Order isthe product that was sent. Flipkart delivered me a product rejected byanother customer. The box has a thick layer of dust. It contains a returnpick up acknowledgement letter dated "2014 May 29" for the same product.The shoes were little soiled & strings of threads from the laces weredangling.I bought the product for my brother. Out of excitement He wore the shoesunaware of my intentions to return the product.Very disappointed by the service.Suja

Hello, No matter how many assurances you give it seems there is no one in your department who is looking into the fact that all these promises are being fulfilled or not. Yesterday there was an order which got delivered, they dint had the machine, still i gave them the money, order no. OD302057545673530701, today again the order came but there is no machine, OD302057545673530702, i took the package he dint had the machine, i dint paid him, as i had already informed you that if the order is above 100 Rs. i am going not going to pay in cash, i will only be paying by card. Secondly, what he went ahead and told the ekart logistics manager and presumably the police (as he said he is calling from the police station) that the packet was snatched and he was slapped. For your very kind information, the packet was taken by my wife, she dint snatched it either also no one slapped him, he dint had the machine so she said u need to bring 1. After a while he came back with the machine, and when i asked him why you dint brought the machine the first time, "he plainly said network nahin aata". I told him on my floor just walk a little distance away and restart the machine, he dint even went there and said network nahin aa raha hai, he dint even tried, just for your very kind information i too am an engineer and i have been living at this place for the last 5 yrs., and i have made card payments to FLIPKART, SNAPDEAL, AMAZON, PAYTM, REDIFF SHOPPING, Koovs where not at this very address. I know for sure that the dogs is never going to be straight, so i am not going to order anything more. Incase you want the payment of Rs. 245 INR, please ask someone to come with the machine and i will do so but before that you need to do the following: 1. *I NEED A WRITTEN APOLOGY LETTER ON YOUR LETTERPAD ON A BOND PAPER OR ELSE I AM GOING TO FILE A DEFAMATION CASE AGAINST YOUR COMPANY AND THAT CHAP BECAUSE NEITHER MY WIFE SNATCHED THE PACKET NOR I SLAPPED HIM. IF I DO NOT GET THE SAME BY MONDAY 6 PM, AT THE SAME ADDRESS THEN I AM DRAGGING YOU TO COURT FOR MALIGNING MY REPUTATION IN THE SOCIETY. I HAVE THE CCTV FOOTAGE AND WOULD WANT EACH ONE OF YOU TO LOOK AT THAT WITH EYES WIDE OPEN AND TELL ME WHERE IS THE SLAP AND WHERE IS THE PACKAGE SNATCHING INCIDENT IN IT WHEN THIS PERSON COMES. RATHER THAN THE SNATCHING, I SHOULD FILE THE FEMALE HARRASEMENT CASE AGAINST YOUR COURIER GUYS. * 2. *IF BY MONDAY 6 PM IST, 16TH FEB, THE LINE FROM YOUR WEBSITE THAT YOU GIVE AN OPTION TO PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN PAY AT YOUR HOME BY CREDIT/DEBIT CARD IS NOT REMOVED FROM YOUR WEBSITE, I WILL AGAIN DRAG YOU TO THE CONSUMER COURT FOR FOOLING THE PUBLIC WHEN YOU DO NOT PROVIDE ANY SUCH OPTION AND I HAVE CC TV FOOTAGE EMAILS AND WHAT NOT WHERE YOU HAVE ALREADY ACCEPTED YOUR MISTAKE FOR THE SAME.* THANKS FOR PROVING TIME AND AGAIN AND THAT U GUYS ARE A BUNCH OF LOOSERS UNTIL THE ABOVE 2 POINTS ARE NOT DONE, PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANYONE TO TAKE THE PAYMENT BECAUSE I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THE MONEY, UNTIL AND UNLESS BOTH THE POINTS I.E. FIRST IS A DEFAMATION CASE AGAINST THAT LIER FROM YOUR COURIER DEPARTMENT AND YOUR COMPANY ALONG WITH EKART LOGISTICS. MY DAD'S A LAWYER HIMSELF SO DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE NITI GRITTIES, HE WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT, BUT FOR YOU IN ORDER TO DO BOTH U HAVE TIME TILL mONDAY 6 PM, I THINIK IT IS DECENT ENOUGH TIME FOR YOU, AND UNTIL THEN AND IWILL NEVER GO FOR OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT SO PLEASE ENSURE THE ABOVE IS DONE BY 6 PM MONDAY OR YOU WILL BE FORCING TO TAKE CRIMINAL ACTION AGAINST YOU FOR AGAIN FOOLOING THIS COUNTRY BY MAKING FALSE PROMISES. Thank and please do not ruin my weekend by calling me,
To flipkart customer Care.,It is very difficult experience today  after i bought the mobile from you.and having tough day.Model : Huawei Honor Holly . pl see below your mail with Order Number,etcgot delivered to me yesterday ( 17.2.15 at 4.30 PM). i switched on todayand inserted sim card. While starting after power on, it is asking Roamingcharges will come like that. even for local incoming calls from local ppland local SMS receivieng are getting charged.  I called Huawei Customercare ( 18002096555)  immediately to avoid my extra roaming phone chargeswhich is getting charged due to this mobile set has some network or someissue as i do not know the problem. They told me to change the setting inNetwork in sim management to disable the roaming button. I did disabled it.But still roaming charges are incurring. Again today evening, i askedHuawei CC, why still this mobile set does not get corrected. He told thisset is meant for international but not for india usage. so , to return itto flipkart and get new one where suits india mode. Is it so??.  I do notknow what is going on while packing at your side when you sale to Indiancustomer. I specifically mentioned my home address clearly in my order formthat i am in pondicherry ( near to tamilnadu state in india). but it isvery surprise to have tough time after incurring 7000 INR to buy this.  Plrevert to me, what is the real issue and how can i return to it to you andhow to get back new mobile .pl note that the same Local sim card  is using by me since 10 years inanother mobile but i do not have any such roaming charges reduced. so, thisis not SIM issue or Airtel issue,it is coming only because of mobile set what you delivered huawei honorholly.what is the guarantee that new mobile set will also does not have sameproblem?pl clear my problem and having headache since bought since today morning.pl solve it by giving process to send back to youpl call me at 9585646365, since the other number what i given for orderingis now in new mobile set got from you. i switched off since roaming chargesgoing up if started using it due to above issueregdsraj

The book that I was to receive as per the website was a set of two volumes,but what I have been delivered is single volume only.The quantity one refers to one set, and not one volume. I can give anotherreasoning for that, the two volumes if I purchase in the market, that isthe real owner seller of the book, I'll get the set of two volumes in Rs.5000. Whereas I had to pay Rs. 3,224 for the book, i.e. the discountedprice payable. However, by delivering one volume I am made to feel that Ihave paid 3000 for one volume, and required to pay even over 6000 for twovolumes. If a person can buy these two volumes from the lexis nexis itselffor 5000, why will he pay 6,448 whilst purchasing from flipkart.Also, it amounts to fraud, if you look at the website it clearly says, "aset of two volumes". Whereas I was delivered first volume only. I got intouch with the customer care dept. the moment I received the book andcomplaint was registered. Kindly look into the matter and address the sameasap

To, The Flipkart Team,                                       This is in regards to the above mentioned order number which I had placed  on 13th Feb 2015 with a delivery within a day. I have always been a fan and a brand loyal of your website and have purchased many products in the past including flipkart first customer service. I am writing this mail today because you people at flipkart have spoliled my Valentine day by delivering me a bad and non working product. How can your quality control team be so careless with a product worth 3000. As I received the product today on 14th feb 2015 and just like a routine I opened the box in front of your courier partner guy Mr.Rahul and was shocked to see the brand box was in a terrible condition with full of dust and the packaging torn moreover the side panel of the watch where it gets locked is slightly rusted and the cherry on the pie is the watch is not working and when I called up your customer service department and I spoke to a lady who answered my query without any concern that due to this bad product my day has been ruined to which she replied that as per our quality control I can see that product was in a saleable condition that's why we have send it to you. M so sorry to inform you that if the product was in a good condition I would not be writing this mail to you moreover I have double proof to prove my point first that I opened the box in front of your courier boy and made a note in his courier register for the same secondly I am attaching picture of the watch and the outer box so you can judge by yourself  that what I am talking about. If this is how you would prefer to gift someone a watch from a brand like Giordano then may be u should buy it and not sell on your website and spoil peoples day and mood.          Lastly I am closing this mail that I demand an apology and also a full refund for the amount spent by me on this trash. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and do the needful asap.  Regards,  Kabir chhabria

Hi,  I have purchased Moto G2 on 7/02/2015 and on Monday(9/02/2015) it fell down in water(not in deep water), after that also mobile was working but after few hours it was automatically switched off. I went to Indiranagar's Sri sai Cell centre but they are advising it will be charged.  As per advertisement and videos the Mobile is water resistance, if it is water resistance than  why it is not working? and according to guys it is one month replacement guaranty, which is not mentioned anywhere.  I see that Service center guys are not good responsive.  I request you to replace the product ASAP, i appreciate your timely response.
return requested no call received but got sms that we tried calling please update mobile no as work is completly hampered due to ur faulty ram make it asap

Im sorry !I did not take the delivery.You people have sent the wrong slippers instead of yellow minion I got somecheap white slippers.They were in a horrible packing. It was a transparent normal polythenecover. So I could see it.I sent it back.You have given the wrong ones. Not satisfied at all.In the last week I gave feedback  saying flipkart is good and all and Iwould recommend to my friends. But not after this issue. I want thoseYELLOW MINION FLIP FLOPS seen in the website.I did not take the white ones with some red lines you sent. This a wrongmail saying the product is delivered.Please check.I guess some one in the delivery process took those and replaced with theones that I saw while delivery.Being a regular flipkart customer, I can 100% assure you its not flipkartpacking. I have bought two slippers in the last week if you want I canqoute the order ids.They were packed well.Also I have ordered same companys another  slippers they are also packedwell.I strongly believe somebody changed them and took my product away.Please look into the matterAnd deliver my Minion slippers yellow color to me.On 16 Feb 2015 19:54,

Dear Flipkart,  I have been a regular and satisfied user of your services. And have never found any complaint regarding the product I purchsed through your site.  But this time I ordered 2 Top Notch T-shirts (XL size) worth Rs 749 (shipping included). But on receiving the product I found that black t-shirt is smaller than the grey one. Which is indeed a shock as both t-shirts tags claim to be of XL size. Therefore I would like to seek its replacement as early as possible.  Warm regards Mohit

Let me know, how you assign a courier agent to a pin code which have already been mentioned by the customer at the time of originating a transaction. Secondly, a courier agent, with his network details could easily verify and say to your agents that the pin code mentioned could not be reachable and you could opt for an alternative agent. So, the error is at the end of Flipkart which in turn compounded with the one of the worst courier services I have ever experienced, First Flight. Creating a sort of confrontation and inducing a pressure at the customer end, is a methodology followed by the after effect of worse competition and is the most unethical way or quality policy that your organisation follow. I also wish to inform that any transaction which I would do with Flipkart has to be through India Courier / other reputed agents who are willing to deliver at the stipulated pin code. Else, forthwith I would decline any offer in spite of their rate competitiveness. Rejeesh

Dear Flipkart Team,  This e-mail is regrading the Order ID OD101774613027128000  Yesterday i recieved the replacement for the Fastrack Analog Watch(which i bought approx a month ago). When i open the box, i found that i got a used product for replacement. The product, i got as replacement, has "Sold On Flipkart" seal broken already, has no price tag, no extra cover on the watch (like on the one i got before), its buckle is also bent more than normal. All it has a already running watch, box with broken seal, and weathered warranty slip sticked on the top, inside the watch. As asked for replacement so that i could get an OK product in place of faulty product but i got a 'more Faulty' product as replacement. I request you to take this faulty product back and provide me with a genuine product in new condition. I'll be thankful to you. I'm sending images as the attachment, of the product and in-box items i got as replacement. Please check the photos and provide me with a new product as the replacement of this one. Wating for the positive reply from your side  Regards Sushant Sharm

Hello,  I have ordered a citizen Eco-Drive watch from flipkart and had high hopes on the quality. But was truly disappointed for reasons below.  1. The box packing was not sealed, and was totally worn-out. 2. The watch did not have a new look, it seems to be a "returned" watch by someone. 3. The chronograph function is not working (big needle doesnt move when the button is pressed)  Here is a screenshot of the order.  [image: Inline images 1]  I immediately raised a request for return on the same day i received the product. I got a call from flipkart executive today after about 48 hours and did not provide any conclusive advise.All I get is we will give a call tomorrow again.  This is totally disappointing. I have high expectations from Flipkart.  Here is what I want:  1. Provide me a replacement watch that is 100% brand new and unused. 2. If the above is not possible, return my money.  Additionally, I placed an order for one more citizen watch and also not totally happy with it.Here is screenshot:  [image: Inline images 2]  Although the watch is functional and I like the model, it also looks like a "returned" watch, because the tag of the watch is not attached to it, it is not in the cover, and the seal is also tampered. When we buy products which are in this expensive range, the minimum expectation is that we get a brand new watch. I have always been happy with Flipkart service, but this time i am totally disappointed.  Please address my issues at the earliest.  Thanks Vijay 990801556

Dear Customer support,This is regarding flipkart order OD002074094434108401.I want to exchange below item but i do not see any link on your site to ask for return. Item which I want to return for exchange: "Black Panther Solid Men's Track Pants" Reason: There is mismatch in information on size chart given on product webpage on flipkart site and actual product supplied.I ordered size M because as per website size M means 32 inches i.e. 81 cm. You supplied size M which is just 71 to 76 Cm. Please send size XL for same item to match with my requirement. Please make necessary arrangement to exchange this product with size XL. Regards,Harshal KhedkarBangalore8105791490

Sir/Madam I want to lodge a complaint against the delivery boy against my order numbers OD302043430892667700 OD302043430892667701 OD302043430892667702 as I am a working lady I gave instructions to the delivery boy to delivery the items only after 4pm as they would be no one to collect the order. But your delivery boy failed to turn up on the instructed time instead I started getting messages stating that ' we couldn't complete your delivery today. We will cal you shortly to provide further assistance' I tried to call on the delivery  boy's number which flashed on my truecaller after getting this message on the second consecutive day without any phone call from this particular agency but unfortunately and sadly nobody picked my call. I got worried about the status of order and checked the status by sending a mail to you from your site and came to know that my order has been requested to cancel. This is so untrue as I was so much looking forward to my favourite perfumes and the main attraction was good schemes on them. I don't want to loose on my order as it is not a mistake of mine. Please is it possible that you take an action against your delivering agency and resend my order... Looking forward for a positive response as I am using your website for the first time and don't want to be disheartened or carry a bad impression. Regards Akanksha Bedi

Hello Today 14-2-15, around 1:30pm your delivery boy came with package and asked for return packet first and wanted to see the item in it. We showed him the item he said fine, and asked to sign for delivery We told him that last time there was just 1 nightsuit, so you check or let us check for 2 nightsuits in package He said i wont do that, you sign and take package, or i m going, We told him problem again. He said, fine i m going. And he just ran away, like last time. We keep on asking him to stop, but he didnt stop He was the same guy who came last time for delivery I told you in my first email of complaint that after taking payment he just ran away This time also, he just ran away. Is there some kind of problem with your delivery boys? I order from myntra and amazon also, they do not have such rude workforce. They never hav any problem with opening of packages, and even if i hav to return, they say it politely that, contact the customercare and ur package will be picked for return later. I wud appreciate if you arrange the delivery of 2 night suits i ordered and that too by some other delivery boy. On 7 Feb 2015 21:53, "Flipkart Customer Support" <cs

It's becoming difficult for me as I am staying in a hostel. I have already invested much of my money in marketing and the refund of the same hasn't been refunded yet. It has crossed about 4 days since the notification of my refund. I want the money by today. So, better tell your bank partners to refund the money by today itself.

This is inform with great CONCERN that the Wrangler Jeans delivered to me was not as per specified order size(30â),By tearing off the coâs size tag and marking with pen ordered size(30â) does not transform the jeans into desired size. You have supplied 81cms(32â)instead of 75cms(30ââ) which  I had ordered for. This is highly demeaning for a co. of  the stature and repute of Flipcart.In case you didnât have the desired size in stock, it would have been prudent on your part to remove the product from your catalogue instead of accepting orders and subsequently supplying wrong sizes.   Anyways, I want a replacement with the correct size  , or money back . Inform how you would do it . Thanx DEBDATTA MUKHERJEE(A highly aggrieved customer)     From:
