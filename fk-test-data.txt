To, The Flipkart Team,                                       This is in regards to the above mentioned order number which I had placed  on 13th Feb 2015 with a delivery within a day. I have always been a fan and a brand loyal of your website and have purchased many products in the past including flipkart first customer service. I am writing this mail today because you people at flipkart have spoliled my Valentine day by delivering me a bad and non working product. How can your quality control team be so careless with a product worth 3000. As I received the product today on 14th feb 2015 and just like a routine I opened the box in front of your courier partner guy Mr.Rahul and was shocked to see the brand box was in a terrible condition with full of dust and the packaging torn moreover the side panel of the watch where it gets locked is slightly rusted and the cherry on the pie is the watch is not working and when I called up your customer service department and I spoke to a lady who answered my query without any concern that due to this bad product my day has been ruined to which she replied that as per our quality control I can see that product was in a saleable condition that's why we have send it to you. M so sorry to inform you that if the product was in a good condition I would not be writing this mail to you moreover I have double proof to prove my point first that I opened the box in front of your courier boy and made a note in his courier register for the same secondly I am attaching picture of the watch and the outer box so you can judge by yourself  that what I am talking about. If this is how you would prefer to gift someone a watch from a brand like Giordano then may be u should buy it and not sell on your website and spoil peoples day and mood.          Lastly I am closing this mail that I demand an apology and also a full refund for the amount spent by me on this trash. Kindly look into this matter at the earliest and do the needful asap.  Regards,  Kabir chhabria

Hi,  I have purchased Moto G2 on 7/02/2015 and on Monday(9/02/2015) it fell down in water(not in deep water), after that also mobile was working but after few hours it was automatically switched off. I went to Indiranagar's Sri sai Cell centre but they are advising it will be charged.  As per advertisement and videos the Mobile is water resistance, if it is water resistance than  why it is not working? and according to guys it is one month replacement guaranty, which is not mentioned anywhere.  I see that Service center guys are not good responsive.  I request you to replace the product ASAP, i appreciate your timely response.
return requested no call received but got sms that we tried calling please update mobile no as work is completly hampered due to ur faulty ram make it asap

My order Id and other details are enclosed in the attached refund receipt. My concern is that the refund is processed only for one item with return Id: 13909001 but not for the other one with return Id: 13926554. For you to better understand my concern, I've also attached the snapshot of my flipkart account. Kindly look into it because this matter has already been too much delayed

Im sorry !I did not take the delivery.You people have sent the wrong slippers instead of yellow minion I got somecheap white slippers.They were in a horrible packing. It was a transparent normal polythenecover. So I could see it.I sent it back.You have given the wrong ones. Not satisfied at all.In the last week I gave feedback  saying flipkart is good and all and Iwould recommend to my friends. But not after this issue. I want thoseYELLOW MINION FLIP FLOPS seen in the website.I did not take the white ones with some red lines you sent. This a wrongmail saying the product is delivered.Please check.I guess some one in the delivery process took those and replaced with theones that I saw while delivery.Being a regular flipkart customer, I can 100% assure you its not flipkartpacking. I have bought two slippers in the last week if you want I canqoute the order ids.They were packed well.Also I have ordered same companys another  slippers they are also packedwell.I strongly believe somebody changed them and took my product away.Please look into the matterAnd deliver my Minion slippers yellow color to me.On 16 Feb 2015 19:54,

Dear Flipkart,  I have been a regular and satisfied user of your services. And have never found any complaint regarding the product I purchsed through your site.  But this time I ordered 2 Top Notch T-shirts (XL size) worth Rs 749 (shipping included). But on receiving the product I found that black t-shirt is smaller than the grey one. Which is indeed a shock as both t-shirts tags claim to be of XL size. Therefore I would like to seek its replacement as early as possible.  Warm regards Mohit

Let me know, how you assign a courier agent to a pin code which have already been mentioned by the customer at the time of originating a transaction. Secondly, a courier agent, with his network details could easily verify and say to your agents that the pin code mentioned could not be reachable and you could opt for an alternative agent. So, the error is at the end of Flipkart which in turn compounded with the one of the worst courier services I have ever experienced, First Flight. Creating a sort of confrontation and inducing a pressure at the customer end, is a methodology followed by the after effect of worse competition and is the most unethical way or quality policy that your organisation follow. I also wish to inform that any transaction which I would do with Flipkart has to be through India Courier / other reputed agents who are willing to deliver at the stipulated pin code. Else, forthwith I would decline any offer in spite of their rate competitiveness. Rejeesh

Team I have finally closed this case by ordering from WS Retail as forced by Flipkart. I wish to put it on record that Flipkart is not what it advertises, but not focussed on what the customer requires. Dealing with Flipkart has been a nightmare! Regards Harshada
Dear Flipkart Team,  This e-mail is regrading the Order ID OD101774613027128000  Yesterday i recieved the replacement for the Fastrack Analog Watch(which i bought approx a month ago). When i open the box, i found that i got a used product for replacement. The product, i got as replacement, has "Sold On Flipkart" seal broken already, has no price tag, no extra cover on the watch (like on the one i got before), its buckle is also bent more than normal. All it has a already running watch, box with broken seal, and weathered warranty slip sticked on the top, inside the watch. As asked for replacement so that i could get an OK product in place of faulty product but i got a 'more Faulty' product as replacement. I request you to take this faulty product back and provide me with a genuine product in new condition. I'll be thankful to you. I'm sending images as the attachment, of the product and in-box items i got as replacement. Please check the photos and provide me with a new product as the replacement of this one. Wating for the positive reply from your side  Regards Sushant Sharm

Hi!  As discussed earlier in the telephonic conversation, I am sending the screen's shots. I would like to mention that as the problem is in the display,  the "light yellow blur spot" is not observed in the screen shots. Hence sending the photos clicked from external camera. Kindly find the fault at the bottom left corner and DO THE NEEDFUL AT THE EARLIEST. Waiting for replacement confirmation now. This is the maximum co-operation I could have.

Hello,  I have ordered a citizen Eco-Drive watch from flipkart and had high hopes on the quality. But was truly disappointed for reasons below.  1. The box packing was not sealed, and was totally worn-out. 2. The watch did not have a new look, it seems to be a "returned" watch by someone. 3. The chronograph function is not working (big needle doesnt move when the button is pressed)  Here is a screenshot of the order.  [image: Inline images 1]  I immediately raised a request for return on the same day i received the product. I got a call from flipkart executive today after about 48 hours and did not provide any conclusive advise.All I get is we will give a call tomorrow again.  This is totally disappointing. I have high expectations from Flipkart.  Here is what I want:  1. Provide me a replacement watch that is 100% brand new and unused. 2. If the above is not possible, return my money.  Additionally, I placed an order for one more citizen watch and also not totally happy with it.Here is screenshot:  [image: Inline images 2]  Although the watch is functional and I like the model, it also looks like a "returned" watch, because the tag of the watch is not attached to it, it is not in the cover, and the seal is also tampered. When we buy products which are in this expensive range, the minimum expectation is that we get a brand new watch. I have always been happy with Flipkart service, but this time i am totally disappointed.  Please address my issues at the earliest.  Thanks Vijay 990801556

Dear Customer support,This is regarding flipkart order OD002074094434108401.I want to exchange below item but i do not see any link on your site to ask for return. Item which I want to return for exchange: "Black Panther Solid Men's Track Pants" Reason: There is mismatch in information on size chart given on product webpage on flipkart site and actual product supplied.I ordered size M because as per website size M means 32 inches i.e. 81 cm. You supplied size M which is just 71 to 76 Cm. Please send size XL for same item to match with my requirement. Please make necessary arrangement to exchange this product with size XL. Regards,Harshal KhedkarBangalore8105791490

Sir/Madam I want to lodge a complaint against the delivery boy against my order numbers OD302043430892667700 OD302043430892667701 OD302043430892667702 as I am a working lady I gave instructions to the delivery boy to delivery the items only after 4pm as they would be no one to collect the order. But your delivery boy failed to turn up on the instructed time instead I started getting messages stating that ' we couldn't complete your delivery today. We will cal you shortly to provide further assistance' I tried to call on the delivery  boy's number which flashed on my truecaller after getting this message on the second consecutive day without any phone call from this particular agency but unfortunately and sadly nobody picked my call. I got worried about the status of order and checked the status by sending a mail to you from your site and came to know that my order has been requested to cancel. This is so untrue as I was so much looking forward to my favourite perfumes and the main attraction was good schemes on them. I don't want to loose on my order as it is not a mistake of mine. Please is it possible that you take an action against your delivering agency and resend my order... Looking forward for a positive response as I am using your website for the first time and don't want to be disheartened or carry a bad impression. Regards Akanksha Bedi

Hello Today 14-2-15, around 1:30pm your delivery boy came with package and asked for return packet first and wanted to see the item in it. We showed him the item he said fine, and asked to sign for delivery We told him that last time there was just 1 nightsuit, so you check or let us check for 2 nightsuits in package He said i wont do that, you sign and take package, or i m going, We told him problem again. He said, fine i m going. And he just ran away, like last time. We keep on asking him to stop, but he didnt stop He was the same guy who came last time for delivery I told you in my first email of complaint that after taking payment he just ran away This time also, he just ran away. Is there some kind of problem with your delivery boys? I order from myntra and amazon also, they do not have such rude workforce. They never hav any problem with opening of packages, and even if i hav to return, they say it politely that, contact the customercare and ur package will be picked for return later. I wud appreciate if you arrange the delivery of 2 night suits i ordered and that too by some other delivery boy. On 7 Feb 2015 21:53, "Flipkart Customer Support" <cs

It's becoming difficult for me as I am staying in a hostel. I have already invested much of my money in marketing and the refund of the same hasn't been refunded yet. It has crossed about 4 days since the notification of my refund. I want the money by today. So, better tell your bank partners to refund the money by today itself.

This is inform with great CONCERN that the Wrangler Jeans delivered to me was not as per specified order size(30â),By tearing off the coâs size tag and marking with pen ordered size(30â) does not transform the jeans into desired size. You have supplied 81cms(32â)instead of 75cms(30ââ) which  I had ordered for. This is highly demeaning for a co. of  the stature and repute of Flipcart.In case you didnât have the desired size in stock, it would have been prudent on your part to remove the product from your catalogue instead of accepting orders and subsequently supplying wrong sizes.   Anyways, I want a replacement with the correct size  , or money back . Inform how you would do it . Thanx DEBDATTA MUKHERJEE(A highly aggrieved customer)     From:

Dear sir,  Sir, Request to ignore my earlier mail, which had few typos like 21st Feb instead of 12th Feb,and follow this email for replying  I ordered for a celkon C6* mobile, black and red colour on 12th feb and received on 14th. On opening the the package,to my disappointment, i got a gold colour piece. On my request for replacement for the colour ordered, to day, on 17th feb 15, at around 12 noon(originally scheduled for delivery on 20th Feb15), i received the replacement, vide courierAWB NoFMPP3239060897 and  to my utter dismay, there was again a gold colour piece inside. This is totally unacceptable and shows the utter disregard  of all concerned with ordering and packing etc.Especially ,in this case, your chosen seller, M/s AASHREY enterprises,HYDERABAD,appears to be utmost careless in their actions, since, even the second time they have shipped the wrong colour piece, even while the retail invoice no.15, accompanying the package clearly mentioned the colour as Black&Red. In case they do not have the required colour, M/S AASHREY,should as well decline your order, but has no right to behave this way and waste everybody's time and energy. I therefore request you to take up this matter seriously and do the needful. In case you have difficulty in getting me the Black&Red.color mobile,i suggest you to please cancel my order and arrange a refund immediately.  Thanking you, S.Narayana Rao 9490167602(M)  Order Id-OD302060304452402500,Dt14-2-2015

Sir, I am a flipkart affiliate and have a flipkart affiliate account registered with email id sumon.bosegunda@gmail.com My concern is that i dont have a P.A.N card and thus i was subjected to 20% TDS deduction. In order to save that i provided my father's PAN details. The bank account, IFSC code is mine but the PAN card registered is not mine, so will i be still subjected to 20% TDS? Also is there any fear of loosing my money?? Please respond fast.                                   Thanking You                                   Sumon Bose

This is the second time I am writing this email which is regarding gift voucher worth Rs. 5,000. We are not getting the Voucher Number and Voucher Pin on this registered email id.We have contacted your customer support team several times but we are not receiving any positive response from your side.We have spoken to several executives like Mohamad Zafar, Rohit, Raja. I don't see any urgency from your side in resolving the issue as we always get standard answer which suggest that the management has lost focus in managing customer grievances.I am repeating the story that whenever I raise complain I am getting a standard email that the problem will be solved in 2 days and a separate email with voucher number and pin will be sent to you shortly. And after that I don't receive any mails from flipkart.My money has been stuck for 2 months without any reason. Please reply or will have to take some severe actions regarding the same.ThanksAbhilash Nambiar9320101263Sent from IBM Notes TravelerThe information contained in this electronic message (email) and any attachments to this email are intended for the exclusive use of the addressee(s) and access to this email by any one else is unauthorised.

Hi.  i have shop many products from flipkart i've been shopping since 6 months and i have made purchase up to 18000 rupees and recently my shopping experience in flipkart is very bad for the past few orders like the very last order i have purchased and moto e grip shells and decryption is it good for 2 to 3 days but when we remove and reinsert it to the phone the grip loses its flexibility and will be non usable for future. I think only because of the street and flipkart has reduced the price of the product from 1100 to 299. I have been wasting my money flipkart from recent orders like moto e grip shell and fila avior sandals. The 2 items i have brought from flipkart were very bad i'm coming to the moto g grip shell recent order is very bad as i said it the grip lost it's flexibility. Too bad experience. I've believed in flipkart and made purchase worth rupees 18000 till now but flipkart doesn't deserve it shop on it anymore. The most think i am getting annoyed is the money i have waited for the past two orders and now please maintain the good service and good products so that in future people like me will not be suffered.Thank you

Hi,  I am your valuable and existing customer. I have order a* Nova Titanium Blades For men NHT 1075 Trimmer* on 10th febuary. when I recieved the product i got to know by the sticker on the box it is *Nova Titanium* Blades For men *NHT 1070 *Not *Nova Titanium Blades For men NHT **1075, which i ordered.*  I called the customer care centre and inform them about the product as you gave the wrong product that cost less than what I ordered actually *NOVA 1075 *. and you charged me for that.  When I open the box i came to know actually it is not NOVA even it is a third type cheap treamer which has a nova sticker on box , so that customer will not mind about that when he will see its written nova but was the local brand which you are claiming as NOVA product as adding a sticker on someother box .  * Please open the file attachment ,look that and compare the original NOVA product box and accessories with this.*   I also want you to send me a apology letter about what you did with me ,* i will also write this mail and send all the conversation to NOVA COMPANY that what actually you are doing with their product.*  I have to give this produst to my one of relative and i gave him when he saw it was like insult and about my reputation he was blaming me that i did that ..  I will also go to consumer court and file a complaint about you .   I want claim about that , dont waste your time and my time

Hi FlipkartThank you for the quick delivery of the order. Unfortunately, your servicesdid not meet my expectations.The delivery was accepted in my absence. the worst part about this Order isthe product that was sent. Flipkart delivered me a product rejected byanother customer. The box has a thick layer of dust. It contains a returnpick up acknowledgement letter dated "2014 May 29" for the same product.The shoes were little soiled & strings of threads from the laces weredangling.I bought the product for my brother. Out of excitement He wore the shoesunaware of my intentions to return the product.Very disappointed by the service.Suja

Dear Sir   I don't want the second one on the screen - Casio Youth Combination Analog Watch - for Men (Black) style code (AD141). Instead of that item I want the first one - Casio Youth Digital Watch - For Men (Black) style code (D083). I have received those two items on 13-2-15 Friday and I am okay with the first item style code (D083). And I have already contacted with your toll free number on Saturday they told me log in with your flipkart account and follow those steps. The thing is that I have clicked on the option Quality Issue, that is not the problem the thing is I need to change that item. So kindly let me know about the status of the item otherwise they will send me the same item to me again. So please get me those details as soon as possible. And I have screen captured of those items and I attached with the mail so kindly find it out.

Dear sir Time and again I have been asking for the refund for the Pavers England Flats. Your email dated 17/02/2015 and 15/02/2015 states that the issue has been resolved but I still haven't received any refund and I am begging for my own money since a long time. All my pleas have been turned to deaf ears and the Peperone bag that I received is ripped from the bottom though the grey one is okay. I have.been a regular customer of flipkart since a very long time but I never expected such dismal quality of products and I have paid for the products and now I have to beg for my own money. Kindly generate a cheque at the earliest possible. I don't want to disclose my bank details and I believe cheque is a safe mode of transfer. Kindly do the needful at the earliest without any further delay.  Regards Akshita Kohli

Dear Team, I am forced by your customer care unit to write this mail to you. This is my registered mail id with you. I had purchased many a items from your store so far. Please refer my transactions history with you. I am deeply disappointed and highly dissatisfied this time with the purchase of Huawei Honor 6 H60-L04 mobile. The details are as below; I received the above said product on 12th Jan 2015. There was a issue with the battery. I registered the complaint online and requested for replacement on 10th Feb 2015 which was well within the replacement period. Your customer care executive contacted me on 11th Feb 2015 and suggested me to reset the mobile, charge and observe the battery life for 2 more days. He also directed me to contact the customer care post two days of observation, if issue persist. As per the direction, I observed the mobile on 12th &amp; 13th of Feb. Since the issue still persisted, I contacted your customer care unit on 14th Feb and narrated the story and requested for replacement.To my surprise, your customer care executive blindly said, the mobile is out of replacement period and that flipkart would not replace the defective unit, without probing or getting into the details.Please note, I had registered for replacement within 30 days which is governed by your terms and conditions and only as per the direction of your customer care executive I had to retain the mobile for 2 more days under observation for which I cannot be held responsible. I suspect, your customer care executives are deliberately misguiding the customers to elapse the replacement period to discourage replacement of defective units.I am completely unhappy with your service this time. Since there is no fault on my side, I would request you to look into the issue judiciously and conclude the issue within 7 days from the date of receipt of this mail.Please note I am deeply disappointed with your service and hence please initiate refund of money and not replacement.Awaiting your response. If you are unable to resolve, let me know your escalation hierarchy matrix with their contact details by return of mail.Regards,  TK Viswanath  9952918929Sent from RediffmailNG on Androi

Hi, I am very much dissatisfied with the product that was sent to me(lenovo A6000)... What is the use of having a smart phone on which I cannoteven install basic applications like whatsapp , Skype updates fromPlaystore? On the same piece I am able to download and install much biggerSystem updates indicating that there is no problem with the internetconnection on the phone...so what goes wrong when it comes to installingapplications from Playstore? Attached are some photographs that will helpyou understand what I mean. (Eleven picture attachments ... I have numberedthem 01,02,03 ...please view in the same sequence) I want my money backplease ...I dont even want to think about a replacement. Pls give me mymoney back!Order ID : OD202049873228338700First return request ID = 14313397Second return request ID = 14446873I am traveling to UK so my phone 9922957062 will not be reachable incase ifyou want to speak with me. Please call on 9922957069 (my father'snumber)....or else please respond on this email so that we can have aconversation. ..Or share a number where you will be reachable so that I cancall back. I had purchased this phone i.e. Lenovo A6000 for my father sothat we could  communicate on Skype and Whatsapp when I will be on aninternational travel. But this whole experience with this product has beenvery painful. I dont have time to do more research on a defective piecebecause I seriously need to travel to UK on Wednesday evening (18th Feb2015). SO Please give me my money back. I dont have time to try anotherpiece. In the attachments, Have a look at the time i.e. the clock in thepicture attachments and the Progress Bar (which indicates progress of thedownload) and you will understand how pathetic the phone is. Looking at thephotos you will clearly understand that while whatsapp download was inprogress, I tried accessing gmail , sent a test mail, received it, AccessedGoogle maps , searched for directions in Google maps, and all this took mevery little time indicating that the internet connection is not at all slow... infact the speed of internet connection is very good... howeverwhatsapp download, happening in the background, did not progress i.e. thedownload Progress Bar did not even progress by 1 millimeter. Why is it so?I am expecting full money back...(I repeat I dont want a replacement)ThanksGirish Zopegirishzope@gmail.comCall on 992295706

I am extremely dissatisfied with Flipkart. You spoiled everything. You are taking 22 DAYS TO DELIVER THE PRODUCT!!!!! I am such a stupid that I opted for Flipkart. It just shows utopia and nothing else. I NEED MY PRODUCT ASAP. I do not like to be rude, but you people are compelling me to be so...hate this service
I have received a email regarding cancellation of my order But i did not cancel my order.. Who told you to cancel my order.. Further, Its too much delay to deliver the product which was not expected from you..  I have made call to your customer around 3 times for my order delivery but you did not make even a single call to confirm the same and now cancelling order also without my confirmation. Why??  Yesterday your courier boy came but he was not having my packet in his Bag.. Whose fault is this??  I want my order immediately now without any further delay and excuse..   Rgfd,  Gitesh

I have made a return request of my Redmi Note 4g on 14.2.2015 <1422015>(Saturday). Your executive said that you will get  a call back from our concerned department and they will solve your problem, he also said that I will receive a call on 15 Feb 2015(Sunday) by 10am. Again when I called your executive said that your request is cancelled and he/she will make a request for second time. Then your executive said that you will receive a call from our product specialist by 7.pm and I even received a message from your side saying the same as your executive said. Now I called again by 7.15pm when "I did not get call by 7pm" again your executive said that you will receive call within 24hours. When last time I made a request it took ten long days and the 11th day I got a call. I am fedup of calling your customer care again and again. I thought you were providing the best service to your customer but now I have changed my mind. Please sovle my problem as soon as possible.
Team - iam very unhappy with the kind of service that your yeam is providing....i am writing this email in regards Â to the said order mentioned in the subject.i still havent received the order. Dont tell me that yhe delivery Â date is on 19th.i know that.I am worried because you have the habit of canceling and apologiesing and refunding some peanuts. .who asked fot it.it was my fathers birthday and I coudlnt gift him anything because of your team...I ordered a micromax bolt ans you cancelled it as you couldn't deliver it. Why are you in this retail business if you cant value emotions.Â I shouldn't have used you in the first place because I know how efficient snapdeal or amazon is.if o dont receive the order on or be before 19th I will take actions.Â RegardsRaviSent from Samsung Mobile
Customer Support team  This mail is to bring to your attention the horrible experience faced by me for shopping online on your site . The aforesaid item ( a pair of Clark shoes) were ordered by me on your website on 14 th feb 2015 in the morning . Payment for the same was made in advance using my credit card on your website on the same day . While placing order the expected date of delivery stated on your website was 17 th feb 2015.  However , as no delivery was attempted on 17 th feb 2015 , I called up the helpline number mentioned on your site to know the exact status of my order as the website was still showing the expected delivery date 17th feb till late evening whereas the order was still showing " under processing" on your site .  First time I called ( around 9:36 pm on 17th feb) , call was attended by your representative named Deepak . He looked into the system and told me that there was some technical issue due to which my order was on HOLD and some concerned team will call me by 27th feb to update me as to when my order can be delivered. When I tried to ask him what was the technical problem , his behaviour got rude as if he was doing some kind of favour by answering to my queries . Since he had no convincing reply to my queries , I asked him to transfer my call to someone senior who could answer my query as to what the technical problem was there with my order and how and when it will be resolved . He put my call on endless hold and no one came to help me resolve the issue. I had no choice to disconnect the call and call back again.  Then I called again at 9:49 pm and spoke to one of your rep and he also put me on hold again ...... and he did not bother to come back to call .  I made a third useless attempt to call your helpline at 10:05 pm and this time call was answered by Umesh .  His attitude was very rude from the beginning of the call itself. He told me that my order cannot be executed as it is on hold as it is yet to be approved by flipkart . When I asked him if the product is unapproved then how it is listed on Flipkart site to be sold . While talking to him I told him that The product is still listed for sale on flipkart site then he had no answer. He was not sure also if the product can actually be delivered or not . When I asked him to Cancel the order and refund the money to me then he told me that this order cannot be cancelled also till 27th feb . He told me that I have no option but to wait till 27th feb and only then someone will inform me that my order can be delivered or not . Till then the only thing I am supposed to do is to wait for the update from flipkart team . He also told me that he was not sure as to payment for my order has come to flipkart or not . When I informed him that my credit card statement is highlighting successful payment made to flipkart then also he did not pay any heed to that .   My question is .....  1. If the order is still unapproved for a particular product then how the product is listed on        flipkart site and moreover quite surprisingly  IT IS STILL BEING SOLD ON FLIPKART SITE       ( WHEN DELIVERY FOR ALREADY SOLD PRODUCT IS STILL A BIG QUESTION ??????)  2.  No one from your team could explain the so called TECHNICAL ISSUE to me . It seems that your helpline staff is not trained enough to answer the queries of a customer and when asked more questions by a customer , they start losing their temper and start getting rude . IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL A GOOD CUSTOMER SUPPORT ?????  3.  Your staff was unable to confirm if payment has been received for my order and when I tried telling me that my credit card statement is reflecting the amount then he was not ready to take my words. If my bank is demanding the payment from me then it is hard to believe that they have failed to make payment to flipkart and also the order would not have been successfully placed also if there was no successful payment. AGAIN THIS 
Hello,I have received a wrong item again. This is not the first time I amreceiving a wrong product. For the same order last time also I got a wrongproduct and raised a replacement. I got refund. When raising last ticketitself I told that the time is getting wasted. Now it's been more than 10days and I have got wrong product.I have attached the product I ordered and the item I received. This isreally a great disappointed from flipkart. I have started getting irritateddue to wrong product and they delay in delivery by the third party supplier.I haven't seen such an irresponsible behaviour from flipkart before. And ifit continues again I am sure it will lose its customer Base day by day.Thanks,Balaj

Hi Team FlipkartI would like to appreciate your hard work to maintaining good relationshipwith your customers.I always suggest my friends to buy products only from Flipkart, and alsobought many products from Flipkart all are genuine products.Recently I have purchased One Item (Order ID: OD201885201106851201) Moto G2 Generation Smart Phone from Flipkart I was really happy Discount price onMoto G2G.Unfortunately I have received defective product (Issue with power socket),I have raised a request for replacement and replacement request has beenapproved seriously I should appreciate services from Flipkart.Finally I have received a new product from Flipkart I am happy with thatbut this time they disappointed by sending again one more defective product.The product I have received under replacement is completely not workingposition that time I was angry on Seller for sending this type of products.I have tried with different methods to power on the device and tried toreboot the device but I couldnât able to do that.Finally again I have approached your customer care executive to escalatethe issue.Next day Morning around 11:30 PM I have received a call from one of yourproduct specialist to resolve the issue.I have tried to explain the issue but she was not yet understands the issueand also she was rejected replacement and forced me to take refund.She also said me to visit Motorola service center to make repair theDevice, Here I have one doubt Why should I went Motorola service center forrepair the mobile I have received from seller is completely not workingcondition.Seller should take responsibility about this issue and also product isunder 30days replacement warranty I said the same thing to her.I was seriously not happy with her behavior and way of explanation of yourexecutive.Finally she was forced approved refund for Refund, but I donât want refund,because I have bought this device with 10% Discount Offer(12999*90/100=11699) Final price is 11699.If I want buy the same mobile again I have to spend 12999 here I am losing1300/- on this device .And also I have spent my valuable time to purchase this item.I am kindly requesting you please replace a new Moto G 2 Generation Mobilewith this defective device and also cancel refund.I believe team Filpkart will maintain valuable relationship with everycostumer who purchased items from Flipkart.Here I am Enclosing screenshots of Mobile this not working condition.I hope I will get positive response from Team Flipkart.Thanks youVamshiDhar Reddy

Hello Flipkart. Hope you are doing well by cheating your previlage customers. I am a previlage customer of flipkart and I am very much unsatisfied today after talking with Your executive. First I was upset with cancilaton of tv on big billion day. Later after getting good response from flipkart I was very happy. They called me and given option to buy another upgraded tv in same price and offer. I was clearly told that EMI interest money won't be getting as it was a new product. But other 2 offers I will be getting i.e. phillips new tv will cost me 27990 and 10% cash back I will be getting If I will book it from citi bank credit card. They told me that I will be getting cash bank by 10th of Feb. I have got rs 4300 cash back in flipkart wallet so tv cost for me was rs27990. I was very happy with good response from flipkart. Today when I enquired about 10 % cash back, response from flipkart executive.. 1. Whom you have spoken with while placing the order. ?. Any one can remember the persons name if you have spoken 2 months before? ????? 2. No we have not offered this... without checking the details he was replying. I Became lier in front of him. The way he was answering as little harsh for me as I was not expecting from flipkart. I stopped buying product from any other online portal and choose flipkart because it is fulfilling all my requirements. But I would like to say that rs 2000 is not a big amount for which any customer will tell lie . And please don't try insult any customer . I have remembered that your customer executive have assured me that I will be getting 10% cash back by 10th of Feb while placing the order. I kindly request you to check my details and do the needful. Don't think in such a way like customer will forget after 2 months. Please find the attached snapshots of my offer which was given me on big billion day. Hoping flipkart will resolve this issue as usual as now it's the matter of my prestige. Regards. Ujjwal Kashyap Mob no. 9902623523

OD 302025597282525300i placed this order on 8th for a laptop and i paid in advance INR 30600 because you promised to deliver it by 12th. i bought this as a valentine gift for 14th.till 12th, everything was normal but when i did not receive it by evening, i called from my side to your customer care, i was told that i will receive it by 7 pm that day only.when i did not receive it , i called again in the night and then i was told it was not despatched even from delhi and got a promise that i shall get it by 15th in any case.very strange nobody from your side bothered to call me to update on this before.i kept on calling and mailing but nobody responded in a responsible manner.everybody was telling me stories about your courier partner. why the hell should i know about your relations with your courier partner. i know and i paid to flipkart for a service which you failed in all senses. on 14th, evening when i was thinking i am about to receive my gift, i got a call first time from your side that i will not be getting it by tomorrow even. and i shall be receiving it by next week.what a team and what a service you are offering to a customer who has paid you 30 k in advance.when i asked him to cancel the order in anger, he was happily and quickly ready to do so, it seems you wanted me to cancel the order because of some odd reason may be product stock out or non viable, strange! he did not ask me once to reconsider my decision of cancellation. and i restrained myself from canceling the order intentionally.i am deeply hurt on emotional level and financial also to a bit. i have all the reasons to pull your management to consumer court and teach a lesson on what a customer is.very annoyed!!

This is justunacceptable,just tell me why i cannot order something on occasion fromflipkart last time too this happened on someone birthday. Then you try togive 50 rupees voucher to shut people away. This is so demoralizing for meto choose flipkart over others, still after last time i ordered again fromyou. But there seems no guarantee to expect the expecting delivery. Again ihave to gift someone after his birthday.Your comportment apalls me. Provide me the reason for delay and i demandsome serious compensation for this.Im forwarding you the mail of last non compliance and snap of my currentorder.I expect a immediate reply

Sir,     Subject: Return request received for Items in Flipkart Order - OD301300753257402200 This mail is regarding aforesaid order of KENSTAR OXYFRYER for which I had requested an exchange. Despite my repeated requests and phonecalls I am not getting any response from you. For your information I bought this product on 17th Nov,2014 and return request was sent to you 13th Dec,2014 i.e. within one month. your technician visited my place to check the appliance on 17thDec,2014 and confirmed the fault in texture of product. Since then this issue is just lingering on. I have got calls for pick up and new delivery almost thrice but of no result. Of late I receive only false assurances of a call back to resolve the issue whenever I call.   I am sorry to inform you that I have not received any call from your office after 31st Jan,2015. I am a very old customers who have been ordering from you almost on routine basis and look at the way you are attending to my complaint. A company like you who has been propagating and selling products under ONE MONTH EXCHANGE POLICY is not exchanging even a faulty product is something very shameful.               I now request you to exchange the product immediately.Aditij Dhamija9811167322
Hello,  It has been 4 days, since I requested for item return and want my money in my wallet. But I am not getting any satisfactorily reply from customer service guys. Today when I called customer service they assured me that item will be picked today and once everything verified Flipkart will initiate refund. Day is almost completed but no one has called me for collection. Is this is Flipkart service ? I believe that Flipkart is genuine towards their customers, but sorry to say that its service is declining. Please help me as soon as possible.  My order number- OD002040608813182500. I have been asked that a collection person will come on Saturday (14-Feb) and pick your item but no one has call me or come to pick an item. Today is Monday 16-Feb, please send the person to collect item and initiate my refund.  Regards, Ashish S (09324386623)

Hey,Â  Â  Â  Â This is to inform you that I (Siddharth Bhutra) had placed an order for the Moto X (2nd Generation) Black on the 15th of February with Order No.OD002085779081527300 delivery of which was received by me today ie. 18th February. My registered Mobile No. is 8100693392 and my Email Id isÂ siddharthbhutra@yahoo.com. I was eligible for a Moto Deck Bluetooth Speaker (Lemon Lime) worth Rs. 8990 as per the order summary but unfortunately I haven't received the same with the delivery of the phone. I would also like to bring to your kind notice that I wasn't satisfied with the Ekart service provided while delivering the phone. The delivery person was an hour late than the time which he had provided me with. He wasn't picking up the phone when I had called (20-25 calls was made by me, all went unanswered). After an hour, the delivery person finally called and was asking me to come to a place where he was instead of coming to my place and delivering the product.Â  Â  Â  Â I would like Flipkart to look into the matter and ensure that the freebie of Moto Deck (Lemon Lime) which i am eligible to is dispatched as soon as possible and ensure that the Ekart service is improved. Hope to hear from you at your earliest with a response to the above mentioned query.Thank You,Siddharth Bhutra+918100693392

Dear Sir,I had ordered haroad official slip Â on 26.01.2015 as per order No.Â OD201914939524570100. Â I have received the same but Â the size of shoe was not fit Â for me. Hence I requested to exchange the same. My requested was accepted and expected delivery date is given 14 feberuary 2015. But till date I have not received the same. I contacted your customer support at Phone No. 01246150000 on 16.02.2015. They informed thatÂ Â exchange is cancelled as address could not be located. However earlier order your delivery man delivered at the same address.I am working in canara bank branch office Nawada fatehpur Â Teh_ Manesar Distt Guragaon Pin-122004 and the same address is given to you for delivery. Â Every body knows this branch in the location. Â Being reputed government Â bank in india, Â A lot of letters/ items are Â being delivered by the various Â courier agencies every day. but it is surprising that your delivery man could neither locate the address nor call me. However earlier order you have delivered at the same address. I have also purchase many items from Home Shop18 and received delivery at the same address before 7 days.I request you to look into the matter and do the needful for further relationship.RegardsShravan KumarMob 9467324948.

Hi, this is Arun. Yesterday, I booked orders for a DLINK Modem+router costing Rs.1540 and a book costing Rs.118. I booked this order by calling at the customer care service of flipcart. But your representative made some mistake while writing the address, he wrote my house no 75/2 instead of 7/2. When I received the confirmation mail from flipcart, I noticed the wrong address. Then I again called the customer care, then yr representative told that he will cancel my previous order and book it once again.     Currently my order ids are OD102086975048380100 and OD102086975048380101. Please start the process as early as possible.If possible please change the Name in my order to Arun from Arjun, yr reprentative wrote it wrong. If it is shipped then there is no problem, I'll accept it.  Order Id cancelled by me-OD302086836669168801 and OD302086836669168800.  I hope I'll receive my order on time. Please send a confirmation mail stating whether my order is in process or till now is it in waiting???

Hi Flipkart,  Totally irritated/ disappointed feel like fool to have transacted with flipkart.  Item bought - Professional 2ProffAsusZen5sg Privacy Screen Guard for Asus Zenfone 5  Please refund full amount as I had decided i willnot buy anything from flipkart going forward.  problems with Flipkart,these accusations are evident from the below points mentioned under  seller problems.  1. Flipkart does not check its sellers. 2. Flipkart does not do surprise product checking/ seller audits. 3. Flipkart does not even check if the  brand mentioned by seller  actually exist or not. 5. Flipkart helps crooks and fraudsters use its brand/ website for a commission / cut in the  fraud earnings.  6.Flipkart has invented the grand idea of by just maintaining a website and enabling a payment  gateway  one can become a e-commerce venture giant. If that is the case then what lesson will  you learn from the failures of rediff shopping/e-bay and other small time shopping websites.E  bay is not trusted by many people for fear of stolen products.  7.Even tele shopping networks and naaptol.com controls the items being sold through their  websites.But flipkart does not have any control.  seller - ShivJiSalesCorp( images attached )   Problems with sellers:  1.The item brand name is professional something -- but i received the item in the package of  skyy platinum  2.The item is cheap china screen guard available in metro stations bus stands for rs.10 per  screen guard.  3.The courier package is sealed inside the courier package the screen guard pack is not  sealed.That means the crook seller has used empty wrapper of some other brand and kept the fake  screen guard inside it.  4.The screen guard was not cut properly to the phone specifications asus zenfone 5 .   5.The screen guard is not privacy screen guard.  with regards,  Vijaya sankar ss chenna

Dear Sir/Madam,I am writing despite being assured that the item would be returned and money refunded. If this will help your organisation then be it. I had initially placed an order for a full sleeve jacket by free culture and was sent a sleeve less one. When I checked the flip kart portal it was cheaper. I asked the item to be returned and a new sleeveless at the new rate be provided. Flip kart did the same but this time gave me a product that is defected because the zip does not work. End conclusion on my side is that some one should be responsible for a mistake twice. Either flipkart or free culture. I only pay flipkart therefore, my association is with them and such attitude on my part will force me to show loyalty to the one that is most professional. If this makes sense then make changes in the way you do your business.Thanking you Deepak Mehta9818408829Sent from my iPhone

After long discussion I am unable to convey thesame to you CS person and I have to agree to your CS person. But on 2ndtime item delivered is not as seen on your web, items which is delivered isin size of 30cmsX45cms 2 sheet of sticker and in two sheet all sticker areof very small size accept 3-4 sticker on sheet and it is not suitable forwall decor purpose.I am very dis-satisfied with the item delivered.I am unable to understand why the same wrong item delivered at every time.This is very bad sign for the fast growing company Flipkart and you arecreating the negative image in customer mind.You are requested to return my money back, because Flipkart are not able todeliver the right item which is mentioned on your websites.Regards,Jayesh Patel9825482738On 16 February 2015 at 19:23,

INCORRECT PRODUCT SENT AGAIN: This is the second instance that the product ordered has been wrongly delivered. The product shown on your site for code: F8J090bt04-BLK Car Charger - the product picture and description show that this is compatible for iPhone 5 as well. But if you look at product box it clearly shows Samsung, HTC etc. Clearly your photoshoot+upload process+product attributes have a mismatch! When I called customer support the person could not find the IFSC code I provided. So really bad experience.... With increasing volumes you are loosing on your quality control of backend channel integration !!! Do something about it!  I tried filling up form for refund of my money but seems your system is not recognizing the IFSC code. I double checked with the bank and they confirmed it is correct . Here are the details: Bank Name: Royal Bank of Scotland N.VAddress - Ocean Heights, K-4, Sector-18, NOIDA - 201301A/C number: 1187043Name: Prashant JainIFSC Code: ABNA0100336 Mobile : 9810625183LL: 01142444761 Let me know if you need more help!

I ordered Huawei honor holly from Flipkart and I have an issue with it. The product which I received opens the task manager by long pressing the menu key.  But now I realised that actually it is opened by double tapping the home button( in reviews of the phone). So I want to know whether It has a technical problem or not?
when i have placed a order then price of rupees hrx printed men s round neck t shirt size l now product is out of stock so i want to my product so quick very fast i have also complaint with flipkart team in the case my product returned by courier many time again by again
i am shocked at the delivery boy insisting for cash saying that the pos is not working etc i thought accepting card was one of your usp claiming and then not accepting is worse than having the policy of not accepting
Dear Customer care, I just want to inform that I am not satisfied with services provided by flipkart.     - Order id-OD001748249713026803(leather jacket). The quality of the    material is very poor. In fact when I received the item, it was already    discolored at two places around the collar.  ## please check the attached photo to have a look.  Order Id-OD001748249713026800 (a saree). On website I selected red color. But when I received the item it wasn't red. It was *Carmine color.*  I understand that u give option to change the item after receiving it. My problem is that I stay abroad (in South Africa) and I told someone else to pick my items from New Delhi. So, I cant return/change the product even if I am not satisfied.  I will never suggest anyone to buy product from flipkart. Your courier system is also not 100% under control. As a customer I don't have anything to do with the supplier of the item. It is supposed to be flipkart sole responsibility about delivery or any issues regarding any order. For your reference you must see the *Jabong *order n delivery systems. Its convenient to track any items delivery online.  I would to love to hear any clarification from your side.  Thank You.     --  With Regards:-  *Kavita Kriti Anand* SAP B1 , Support HP Mail: kavitakritianand@gmail.com contact- +91-9312969747, 971613915

Hello, I am shocked to see that after 15 days of your confirmation i have not received any refund in my account, All account details were given almost 20 days back and 15 days back you confirmed that i will get refund in next 8 working days. How long you will take to refund my money, and stop exploiting me. For your kind information no body has come to pick any jacket and no call has come to me as well, don't give any false statement. In case i don't get refund in next one week i will go to consumer court against you. Warm Regards Deepak Narang Ph.

I think it won't be appropriate to explain same issue again and again because flipakt will what they have to do...despite my several and timely humble request you credited the amount in my wallet and I was the only one who was baging yes I mean baging to you that please do not credit this amount into my wallet because I need replacement not the amount...flipkart you hurt me a lot you people also assured me for not crediting the amount into my wallet and will replace whenever it will came in stock. Yes made the commitment for that you can check the history... There is a lot of words are boiling in my heart but I doesn't affect you at all...there is one thing has been left behind by flipkart and that is disappointment and disappointment....as you people asked me to let you know when the product available in stock which was totally your job but I keep visiting your website and called you that this product is available in morning and also asked not to credit money into my wallet. Think about  your 100% customer satisfaction tag line flipkart. You may contact me on this number 9812242477 to hear disappointed heart live. But I don't think my words and disappointment are  going to bother you. Anyway thank you.
