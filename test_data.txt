"Don't speak so loud, or she will wake," said the toad, "and then she might run away, for she is as light as swan's down.
We will place her on one of the water-lily leaves out in the stream; it will be like an island to her, she is so light and small, and then she cannot escape; and, while she is away, we will make haste and prepare the state-room under the marsh, in which you are to live when you are married."
Far out in the stream grew a number of water-lilies, with broad green leaves, which seemed to float on the top of the water.
The largest of these leaves appeared farther off than the rest, and the old toad swam out to it with the walnut-shell, in which little Tiny lay still asleep.
The tiny little creature woke very early in the morning, and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was, for she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf, and no way of reaching the land.
Meanwhile the old toad was very busy under the marsh, decking her room with rushes and wild yellow flowers, to make it look pretty for her new daughter-in-law.
Then she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf on which she had placed poor little Tiny.
She wanted to fetch the pretty bed, that she might put it in the bridal chamber to be ready for her.
The old toad bowed low to her in the water, and said, "Here is my son, he will be your husband, and you will live happily in the marsh by the stream."
"Croak, croak, croak," was all her son could say for himself; so the toad took up the elegant little bed, and swam away with it, leaving Tiny all alone on the green leaf, where she sat and wept.
She could not bear to think of living with the old toad, and having her ugly son for a husband.
The little fishes, who swam about in the water beneath, had seen the toad, and heard what she said, so they lifted their heads above the water to look at the little maiden.
As soon as they caught sight of her, they saw she was very pretty, and it made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the ugly toads.
"No, it must never be!" so they assembled together in the water, round the green stalk which held the leaf on which the little maiden stood, and gnawed it away at the root with their teeth.
Then the leaf floated down the stream, carrying Tiny far away out of reach of land.
Tiny sailed past many towns, and the little birds in the bushes saw her, and sang, "What a lovely little creature;" so the leaf swam away with her farther and farther, till it brought her to other lands.
A graceful little white butterfly constantly fluttered round her, and at last alighted on the leaf.
Tiny pleased him, and she was glad of it, for now the toad could not possibly reach her, and the country through which she sailed was beautiful, and the sun shone upon the water, till it glittered like liquid gold.
She took off her girdle and tied one end of it round the butterfly, and the other end of the ribbon she fastened to the leaf, which now glided on much faster than ever, taking little Tiny with it as she stood.
Presently a large cockchafer flew by; the moment he caught sight of her, he seized her round her delicate waist with his claws, and flew with her into a tree.
The green leaf floated away on the brook, and the butterfly flew with it, for he was fastened to it, and could not get away.
Oh, how frightened little Tiny felt when the cockchafer flew with her to the tree!
But especially was she sorry for the beautiful white butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf, for if he could not free himself he would die of hunger.
But the cockchafer did not trouble himself at all about the matter.
He seated himself by her side on a large green leaf, gave her some honey from the flowers to eat, and told her she was very pretty, though not in the least like a cockchafer.
After a time, all the cockchafers turned up their feelers, and said, "She has only two legs! how ugly that looks."
"She has no feelers," said another.
"Her waist is quite slim.
Pooh! she is like a human being."
"Oh! she is ugly," said all the lady cockchafers, although Tiny was very pretty.
Then the cockchafer who had run away with her, believed all the others when they said she was ugly, and would have nothing more to say to her, and told her she might go where she liked.
Then he flew down with her from the tree, and placed her on a daisy, and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the cockchafers would have nothing to say to her.
And all the while she was really the loveliest creature that one could imagine, and as tender and delicate as a beautiful rose-leaf.
During the whole summer poor little Tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest.
She wove herself a bed with blades of grass, and hung it up under a broad leaf, to protect herself from the rain.
She sucked the honey from the flowers for food, and drank the dew from their leaves every morning.
So passed away the summer and the autumn, and then came the winter,- the long, cold winter.
All the birds who had sung to her so sweetly were flown away, and the trees and the flowers had withered.
The large clover leaf under the shelter of which she had lived, was now rolled together and shrivelled up, nothing remained but a yellow withered stalk.
She felt dreadfully cold, for her clothes were torn, and she was herself so frail and delicate, that poor little Tiny was nearly frozen to death.
It began to snow too; and the snow-flakes, as they fell upon her, were like a whole shovelful falling upon one of us, for we are tall, but she was only an inch high.
Then she wrapped herself up in a dry leaf, but it cracked in the middle and could not keep her warm, and she shivered with cold.
Near the wood in which she had been living lay a corn-field, but the corn had been cut a long time; nothing remained but the bare dry stubble standing up out of the frozen ground.
It was to her like struggling through a large wood.
Oh! how she shivered with the cold.
She came at last to the door of a field-mouse, who had a little den under the corn-stubble.
There dwelt the field-mouse in warmth and comfort, with a whole roomful of corn, a kitchen, and a beautiful dining room.
Poor little Tiny stood before the door just like a little beggar-girl, and begged for a small piece of barley-corn, for she had been without a morsel to eat for two days.
"You poor little creature," said the field-mouse, who was really a good old field-mouse, "come into my warm room and dine with me."
She was very pleased with Tiny, so she said, "You are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter, if you like; but you must keep my rooms clean and neat, and tell me stories, for I shall like to hear them very much."
And Tiny did all the field-mouse asked her, and found herself very comfortable.
"We shall have a visitor soon," said the field-mouse one day; "my neighbor pays me a visit once a week.
He is better off than I am; he has large rooms, and wears a beautiful black velvet coat.
If you could only have him for a husband, you would be well provided for indeed.
But he is blind, so you must tell him some of your prettiest stories.
But Tiny did not feel at all interested about this neighbor, for he was a mole.
However, he came and paid his visit dressed in his black velvet coat.
"He is very rich and learned, and his house is twenty times larger than mine," said the field-mouse.
He was rich and learned, no doubt, but he always spoke slightingly of the sun and the pretty flowers, because he had never seen them.
Tiny was obliged to sing to him, "Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home," and many other pretty songs.
And the mole fell in love with her because she had such a sweet voice; but he said nothing yet, for he was very cautious.
A short time before, the mole had dug a long passage under the earth, which led from the dwelling of the field-mouse to his own, and here she had permission to walk with Tiny whenever she liked.
But he warned them not to be alarmed at the sight of a dead bird which lay in the passage.
It was a perfect bird, with a beak and feathers, and could not have been dead long, and was lying just where the mole had made his passage.
The mole took a piece of phosphorescent wood in his mouth, and it glittered like fire in the dark; then he went before them to light them through the long, dark passage.
When they came to the spot where lay the dead bird, the mole pushed his broad nose through the ceiling, the earth gave way, so that there was a large hole, and the daylight shone into the passage.
In the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow, his beautiful wings pulled close to his sides, his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the cold.
It made little Tiny very sad to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so beautifully.
But the mole pushed it aside with his crooked legs, and said, "He will sing no more now.
How miserable it must be to be born a little bird!
I am thankful that none of my children will ever be birds, for they can do nothing but cry, 'Tweet, tweet,' and always die of hunger in the winter."
"Yes, you may well say that, as a clever man!" exclaimed the field-mouse, "What is the use of his twittering, for when winter comes he must either starve or be frozen to death.
Still birds are very high bred."
Tiny said nothing; but when the two others had turned their backs on the bird, she stooped down and stroked aside the soft feathers which covered the head, and kissed the closed eyelids.
"Perhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the summer," she said; "and how much pleasure it gave me, you dear, pretty bird."
The mole now stopped up the hole through which the daylight shone, and then accompanied the lady home.
But during the night Tiny could not sleep; so she got out of bed and wove a large, beautiful carpet of hay; then she carried it to the dead bird, and spread it over him; with some down from the flowers which she had found in the field-mouse's room.
It was as soft as wool, and she spread some of it on each side of the bird, so that he might lie warmly in the cold earth.
"Farewell, you pretty little bird," said she, "farewell; thank you for your delightful singing during the summer, when all the trees were green, and the warm sun shone upon us.
Then she laid her head on the bird's breast, but she was alarmed immediately, for it seemed as if something inside the bird went "thump, thump."
It was the bird's heart; he was not really dead, only benumbed with the cold, and the warmth had restored him to life.
In autumn, all the swallows fly away into warm countries, but if one happens to linger, the cold seizes it, it becomes frozen, and falls down as if dead; it remains where it fell, and the cold snow covers it.
Tiny trembled very much; she was quite frightened, for the bird was large, a great deal larger than herself,- she was only an inch high.
But she took courage, laid the wool more thickly over the poor swallow, and then took a leaf which she had used for her own counterpane, and laid it over the head of the poor bird.
The next morning she again stole out to see him.
He was alive but very weak; he could only open his eyes for a moment to look at Tiny, who stood by holding a piece of decayed wood in her hand, for she had no other lantern.
"Thank you, pretty little maiden," said the sick swallow; "I have been so nicely warmed, that I shall soon regain my strength, and be able to fly about again in the warm sunshine."
"Oh," said she, "it is cold out of doors now; it snows and freezes.
Stay in your warm bed; I will take care of you."
Then she brought the swallow some water in a flower-leaf, and after he had drank, he told her that he had wounded one of his wings in a thorn-bush, and could not fly as fast as the others, who were soon far away on their journey to warm countries.
Then at last he had fallen to the earth, and could remember no more, nor how he came to be where she had found him.
The whole winter the swallow remained underground, and Tiny nursed him with care and love.
Neither the mole nor the field-mouse knew anything about it, for they did not like swallows.
Very soon the spring time came, and the sun warmed the earth.
Then the swallow bade farewell to Tiny, and she opened the hole in the ceiling which the mole had made.
The sun shone in upon them so beautifully, that the swallow asked her if she would go with him; she could sit on his back, he said, and he would fly away with her into the green woods.
But Tiny knew it would make the field-mouse very grieved if she left her in that manner, so she said, "No, I cannot."
"Farewell, then, farewell, you good, pretty little maiden," said the swallow; and he flew out into the sunshine.
Tiny looked after him, and the tears rose in her eyes.
She was very fond of the poor swallow.
"Tweet, tweet," sang the bird, as he flew out into the green woods, and Tiny felt very sad.
She was not allowed to go out into the warm sunshine.
The corn which had been sown in the field over the house of the field-mouse had grown up high into the air, and formed a thick wood to Tiny, who was only an inch in height.
"You are going to be married, Tiny," said the field-mouse.
"My neighbor has asked for you.
What good fortune for a poor child like you.
Now we will prepare your wedding clothes.
They must be both woollen and linen.
Nothing must be wanting when you are the mole's wife."
Tiny had to turn the spindle, and the field-mouse hired four spiders, who were to weave day and night.
Every evening the mole visited her, and was continually speaking of the time when the summer would be over.
Then he would keep his wedding-day with Tiny; but now the heat of the sun was so great that it burned the earth, and made it quite hard, like a stone.
As soon, as the summer was over, the wedding should take place.
But Tiny was not at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole.
Every morning when the sun rose, and every evening when it went down, she would creep out at the door, and as the wind blew aside the ears of corn, so that she could see the blue sky, she thought how beautiful and bright it seemed out there, and wished so much to see her dear swallow again.
But he never returned; for by this time he had flown far away into the lovely green forest.
When autumn arrived, Tiny had her outfit quite ready; and the field-mouse said to her, "In four weeks the wedding must take place."
Then Tiny wept, and said she would not marry the disagreeable mole.
"Nonsense," replied the field-mouse.
"Now don't be obstinate, or I shall bite you with my white teeth.
He is a very handsome mole; the queen herself does not wear more beautiful velvets and furs.
His kitchen and cellars are quite full.
You ought to be very thankful for such good fortune."
So the wedding-day was fixed, on which the mole was to fetch Tiny away to live with him, deep under the earth, and never again to see the warm sun, because he did not like it.
The poor child was very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful sun, and as the field-mouse had given her permission to stand at the door, she went to look at it once more.
"Farewell bright sun," she cried, stretching out her arm towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house; for the corn had been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the fields.
"Farewell, farewell," she repeated, twining her arm round a little red flower that grew just by her side.
"Greet the little swallow from me, if you should see him again."
"Tweet, tweet," sounded over her head suddenly.
She looked up, and there was the swallow himself flying close by.
As soon as he spied Tiny, he was delighted; and then she told him how unwilling she felt to marry the ugly mole, and to live always beneath the earth, and never to see the bright sun any more.
And as she told him she wept.
"Cold winter is coming," said the swallow, "and I am going to fly away into warmer countries.
Will you go with me?
You can sit on my back, and fasten yourself on with your sash.
Then we can fly away from the ugly mole and his gloomy rooms,- far away, over the mountains, into warmer countries, where the sun shines more brightly- than here; where it is always summer, and the flowers bloom in greater beauty.
Fly now with me, dear little Tiny; you saved my life when I lay frozen in that dark passage."
"Yes, I will go with you," said Tiny; and she seated herself on the bird's back, with her feet on his outstretched wings, and tied her girdle to one of his strongest feathers.
Then the swallow rose in the air, and flew over forest and over sea, high above the highest mountains, covered with eternal snow.
Tiny would have been frozen in the cold air, but she crept under the bird's warm feathers, keeping her little head uncovered, so that she might admire the beautiful lands over which they passed.
At length they reached the warm countries, where the sun shines brightly, and the sky seems so much higher above the earth.
Here, on the hedges, and by the wayside, grew purple, green, and white grapes; lemons and oranges hung from trees in the woods; and the air was fragrant with myrtles and orange blossoms.
Beautiful children ran along the country lanes, playing with large gay butterflies; and as the swallow flew farther and farther, every place appeared still more lovely.
At last they came to a blue lake, and by the side of it, shaded by trees of the deepest green, stood a palace of dazzling white marble, built in the olden times.
Vines clustered round its lofty pillars, and at the top were many swallows' nests, and one of these was the home of the swallow who carried Tiny.
"This is my house," said the swallow; "but it would not do for you to live there- you would not be comfortable.
You must choose for yourself one of those lovely flowers, and I will put you down upon it, and then you shall have everything that you can wish to make you happy."
"That will be delightful," she said, and clapped her little hands for joy.
A large marble pillar lay on the ground, which, in falling, had been broken into three pieces.
Between these pieces grew the most beautiful large white flowers; so the swallow flew down with Tiny, and placed her on one of the broad leaves.
But how surprised she was to see in the middle of the flower, a tiny little man, as white and transparent as if he had been made of crystal!
He had a gold crown on his head, and delicate wings at his shoulders, and was not much larger than Tiny herself.
He was the angel of the flower; for a tiny man and a tiny woman dwell in every flower; and this was the king of them all.
"Oh, how beautiful he is!" whispered Tiny to the swallow.
The little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird, who was like a giant, compared to such a delicate little creature as himself; but when he saw Tiny, he was delighted, and thought her the prettiest little maiden he had ever seen.
He took the gold crown from his head, and placed it on hers, and asked her name, and if she would be his wife, and queen over all the flowers.
This certainly was a very different sort of husband to the son of a toad, or the mole, with my black velvet and fur; so she said, "Yes," to the handsome prince.
Then all the flowers opened, and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord, all so pretty it was quite a pleasure to look at them.
Each of them brought Tiny a present; but the best gift was a pair of beautiful wings, which had belonged to a large white fly and they fastened them to Tiny's shoulders, so that she might fly from flower to flower.
Then there was much rejoicing, and the little swallow who sat above them, in his nest, was asked to sing a wedding song, which he did as well as he could; but in his heart he felt sad for he was very fond of Tiny, and would have liked never to part from her again.
"You must not be called Tiny any more," said the spirit of the flowers to her.
"It is an ugly name, and you are so very pretty.
We will call you Maia."
"Farewell, farewell," said the swallow, with a heavy heart as he left the warm countries to fly back into Denmark.
There he had a nest over the window of a house in which dwelt the writer of fairy tales.
The swallow sang, "Tweet, tweet," and from his song came the whole story.
YES, they called him Little Tuk, but it was not his real name; he had called himself so before he could speak plainly, and he meant it for Charles.
It was all very well for those who knew him, but not for strangers.
Little Tuk was left at home to take care of his little sister, Gustava, who was much younger than himself, and he had to learn his lessons at the same time, and the two things could not very well be performed together.
The poor boy sat there with his sister on his lap, and sung to her all the songs he knew, and now and then he looked into his geography lesson that lay open before him.
By the next morning he had to learn by heart all the towns in Zealand, and all that could be described of them.
His mother came home at last, and took little Gustava in her arms.
Then Tuk ran to the window, and read so eagerly that he nearly read his eyes out; for it had become darker and darker every minute, and his mother had no money to buy a light.
"There goes the old washerwoman up the lane," said the mother, as she looked out of the window; "the poor woman can hardly drag herself along, and now she had to drag a pail of water from the well.
Be a good boy, Tuk, and run across and help the old woman, won't you?"
So Tuk ran across quickly, and helped her, but when he came back into the room it was quite dark, and there was not a word said about a light, so he was obliged to go to bed on his little truckle bedstead, and there he lay and thought of his geography lesson, and of Zealand, and of all the master had told him.
He ought really to have read it over again, but he could not for want of light.
So he put the geography book under his pillow, for he had heard that this was a great help towards learning a lesson, but not always to be depended upon.
He still lay thinking and thinking, when all at once it seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes and mouth.
He slept and yet he did not sleep; and it appeared as if the old washerwoman looked at him with kind eyes and said, "It would be a great pity if you did not know your lesson to-morrow morning; you helped me, and now I will help you, and Providence will always keep those who help themselves;" and at the same time the book under Tuk's pillow began to move about.
"Cluck, cluck, cluck," cried a hen as she crept towards him.
"I am a hen from Kjoge," and then she told him how many inhabitants the town contained, and about a battle that had been fought there, which really was not worth speaking of.
"Crack, crack," down fell something.
It was a wooden bird, the parrot which is used as a target as Prastoe.
He said there were as many inhabitants in that town as he had nails in his body.
He was very proud, and said, "Thorwalsden lived close to me, and here I am now, quite comfortable."
But now little Tuk was no longer in bed; all in a moment he found himself on horseback.
Gallop, gallop, away he went, seated in front of a richly-attired knight, with a waving plume, who held him on the saddle, and so they rode through the wood by the old town of Wordingburg, which was very large and busy.
The king's castle was surrounded by lofty towers, and radiant light streamed from all the windows.
Within there were songs and dancing; King Waldemar and the young gayly-dressed ladies of the court were dancing together.
Morning dawned, and as the sun rose, the whole city and the king's castle sank suddenly down together.
One tower after another fell, till at last only one remained standing on the hill where the castle had formerly been.
The town now appeared small and poor, and the school-boys read in their books, which they carried under their arms, that it contained two thousand inhabitants; but this was a mere boast, for it did not contain so many.
And again little Tuk lay in his bed, scarcely knowing whether he was dreaming or not, for some one stood by him.
"Tuk! little Tuk!" said a voice.
It was a very little person who spoke.
He was dressed as a sailor, and looked small enough to be a middy, but he was not one.
"I bring you many greetings from Corsor.
It is a rising town, full of life.
It has steamships and mail-coaches.
In times past they used to call it ugly, but that is no longer true.
I lie on the sea-shore," said Corsor; "I have high-roads and pleasure-gardens; I have given birth to a poet who was witty and entertaining, which they are not all.
I once wanted to fit out a ship to sail round the world, but I did not accomplish it, though most likely I might have done so.
But I am fragrant with perfume, for close to my gates most lovely roses bloom."
Then before the eyes of little Tuk appeared a confusion of colors, red and green; but it cleared off, and he could distinguish a cliff close to the bay, the slopes of which were quite overgrown with verdure, and on its summit stood a fine old church with pointed towers.
Springs of water flowed out of the cliff in thick waterspouts, so that there was a continual splashing.
Close by sat an old king with a golden crown on his white head.
This was King Hroar of the Springs and near the springs stood the town of Roeskilde, as it is called.
Then all the kings and queens of Denmark went up the ascent to the old church, hand in hand, with golden crowns on their heads, while the organ played and the fountains sent forth jets of water.
Little Tuk saw and heard it all.
"Don't forget the names of these towns," said King Hroar.
All at once everything vanished; but where!
It seemed to him like turning over the leaves of a book.
And now there stood before him an old peasant woman, who had come from Soroe where the grass grows in the market-place.
She had a green linen apron thrown over her head and shoulders, and it was quite wet, as if it had been raining heavily.
"Yes, that it has," said she, and then, just as she was going to tell him a great many pretty stories from Holberg's comedies, and about Waldemar and Absalom, she suddenly shrunk up together, and wagged her head as if she were a frog about to spring.
"Croak," she cried; "it is always wet, and as quiet as death in Soroe."
Then little Tuk saw she was changed into a frog.
"Croak," and again she was an old woman.
"One must dress according to the weather," said she.
"It is wet, and my town is just like a bottle.
By the cork we must go in, and by the cork we must come out again.
In olden times I had beautiful fish, and now I have fresh, rosy-cheeked boys in the bottom of the bottle, and they learn wisdom, Hebrew and Greek."
"Croak."
How it sounded like the cry of the frogs on the moor, or like the creaking of great boots when some one is marching,- always the same tone, so monotonous and wearing, that little Tuk at length fell fast asleep, and then the sound could not annoy him.
But even in this sleep came a dream or something like it.
His little sister Gustava, with her blue eyes, and fair curly hair, had grown up a beautiful maiden all at once, and without having wings she could fly.
And they flew together over Zealand, over green forests and blue lakes.
"Hark, so you hear the cock crow, little Tuk.
'Cock-a-doodle-doo.'
The fowls are flying out of Kjoge.
You shall have a large farm-yard.
You shall never suffer hunger or want.
The bird of good omen shall be yours, and you shall become a rich and happy man; your house shall rise up like King Waldemar's towers, and shall be richly adorned with marble statues, like those at Prastoe.
Understand me well; your name shall travel with fame round the world like the ship that was to sail from Corsor, and at Roeskilde,- Don't forget the names of the towns, as King Hroar said,- you shall speak well and clearly little Tuk, and when at last you lie in your grave you shall sleep peacefully, as-" "As if I lay in Soroe," said little Tuk awaking.
It was bright daylight, and he could not remember his dream, but that was not necessary, for we are not to know what will happen to us in the future.
Then he sprang out of bed quickly, and read over his lesson in the book, and knew it all at once quite correctly.
The old washerwoman put her head in at the door, and nodded to him quite kindly, and said, "Many thanks, you good child, for your help yesterday.
I hope all your beautiful dreams will come true."
Little Tuk did not at all know what he had dreamt, but One above did.
THERE lived once a great queen, in whose garden were found at all seasons the most splendid flowers, and from every land in the world.
She specially loved roses, and therefore she possessed the most beautiful varieties of this flower, from the wild hedge-rose, with its apple-scented leaves, to the splendid Provence rose.
They grew near the shelter of the walls, wound themselves round columns and window-frames, crept along passages and over the ceilings of the halls.
They were of every fragrance and color.
But care and sorrow dwelt within these halls; the queen lay upon a sick bed, and the doctors declared that she must die.
"There is still one thing that could save her," said one of the wisest among them.
"Bring her the loveliest rose in the world; one which exhibits the purest and brightest love, and if it is brought to her before her eyes close, she will not die."
Then from all parts came those who brought roses that bloomed in every garden, but they were not the right sort.
The flower must be one from the garden of love; but which of the roses there showed forth the highest and purest love?
The poets sang of this rose, the loveliest in the world, and each named one which he considered worthy of that title; and intelligence of what was required was sent far and wide to every heart that beat with love; to every class, age, and condition.
"No one has yet named the flower," said the wise man.
"No one has pointed out the spot where it blooms in all its splendor.
It is not a rose from the coffin of Romeo and Juliet, or from the grave of Walburg, though these roses will live in everlasting song.
It is not one of the roses which sprouted forth from the blood-stained fame of Winkelreid.
The blood which flows from the breast of a hero who dies for his country is sacred, and his memory is sweet, and no rose can be redder than the blood which flows from his veins.
Neither is it the magic flower of Science, to obtain which wondrous flower a man devotes many an hour of his fresh young life in sleepless nights, in a lonely chamber."
"I know where it blooms," said a happy mother, who came with her lovely child to the bedside of the queen.
"I know where the loveliest rose in the world is.
It is seen on the blooming cheeks of my sweet child, when it expresses the pure and holy love of infancy; when refreshed by sleep it opens its eyes, and smiles upon me with childlike affection."
"This is a lovely rose," said the wise man; "but there is one still more lovely."
"Yes, one far more lovely," said one of the women.
"I have seen it, and a loftier and purer rose does not bloom.
But it was white, like the leaves of a blush-rose.
I saw it on the cheeks of the queen.
She had taken off her golden crown, and through the long, dreary night, she carried her sick child in her arms.
She wept over it, kissed it, and prayed for it as only a mother can pray in that hour of her anguish."
"Holy and wonderful in its might is the white rose of grief, but it is not the one we seek."
"No; the loveliest rose in the world I saw at the Lord's table," said the good old bishop.
"I saw it shine as if an angel's face had appeared.
A young maiden knelt at the altar, and renewed the vows made at her baptism; and there were white roses and red roses on the blushing cheeks of that young girl.
She looked up to heaven with all the purity and love of her young spirit, in all the expression of the highest and purest love."
"May she be blessed!" said the wise man: "but no one has yet named the loveliest rose in the world."
Then there came into the room a child- the queen's little son.
Tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps.
"Mother," cried the little boy; "only hear what I have read."
And the child seated himself by the bedside, and read from the book of Him who suffered death on the cross to save all men, even who are yet unborn.
He read, "Greater love hath no man than this," and as he read a roseate hue spread over the cheeks of the queen, and her eyes became so enlightened and clear, that she saw from the leaves of the book a lovely rose spring forth, a type of Him who shed His blood on the cross.
"I see it," she said.
"He who beholds this, the loveliest rose on earth, shall never die."
IT was bitterly cold, the sky glittered with stars, and not a breeze stirred.
"Bump"- an old pot was thrown at a neighbor's door; and "bang, bang," went the guns; for they were greeting the New Year.
It was New Year's Eve, and the church clock was striking twelve.
"Tan-ta-ra-ra, tan-ta-ra-ra," sounded the horn, and the mail-coach came lumbering up.
The clumsy vehicle stopped at the gate of the town; all the places had been taken, for there were twelve passengers in the coach.
"Hurrah! hurrah!" cried the people in the town; for in every house the New Year was being welcomed; and as the clock struck, they stood up, the full glasses in their hands, to drink success to the new comer.
"A happy New Year," was the cry; "a pretty wife, plenty of money, and no sorrow or care."
The wish passed round, and the glasses clashed together till they rang again; while before the town-gate the mail coach stopped with the twelve strange passengers.
And who were these strangers?
Each of them had his passport and his luggage with him; they even brought presents for me, and for you, and for all the people in the town.
"Who were they? what did they want? and what did they bring with them?"
"Good-morning," they cried to the sentry at the town-gate.
"Good-morning," replied the sentry; for the clock had struck twelve.
"Your name and profession?" asked the sentry of the one who alighted first from the carriage.
"See for yourself in the passport," he replied.
"I am myself;" and a famous fellow he looked, arrayed in bear-skin and fur boots.
"I am the man on whom many persons fix their hopes.
Come to me to-morrow, and I'll give you a New Year's present.
I throw shillings and pence among the people; I give balls, no less than thirty-one; indeed, that is the highest number I can spare for balls.
My ships are often frozen in, but in my offices it is warm and comfortable.
My name is JANUARY.
I'm a merchant, and I generally bring my accounts with me."
Then the second alighted.
He seemed a merry fellow.
He was a director of a theatre, a manager of masked balls, and a leader of all the amusements we can imagine.
His luggage consisted of a great cask.
"We'll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time," said he; "I'll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too.
Unfortunately I have not long to live- the shortest time, in fact, of my whole family- only twenty-eight days.
Sometimes they pop me in a day extra; but I trouble myself very little about that.
Hurrah!"
"You must not shout so," said the sentry.
"Certainly I may shout," retorted the man; "I'm Prince Carnival, travelling under the name of FEBRUARY."
The third now got out.
He looked a personification of fasting; but he carried his nose very high, for he was related to the "forty (k)nights," and was a weather prophet.
But that is not a very lucrative office, and therefore he praised fasting.
In his button-hole he carried a little bunch of violets, but they were very small.
"MARCH, March," the fourth called after him, slapping him on the shoulder, "don't you smell something?
Make haste into the guard room; they're drinking punch there; that's your favorite drink.
I can smell it out here already.
Forward, Master March."
But it was not true; the speaker only wanted to remind him of his name, and to make an APRIL fool of him; for with that fun the fourth generally began his career.
He looked very jovial, did little work, and had the more holidays.
"If the world were only a little more settled," said he: "but sometimes I'm obliged to be in a good humor, and sometimes a bad one, according to circumstances; now rain, now sunshine.
I'm kind of a house agent, also a manager of funerals.
I can laugh or cry, according to circumstances.
I have my summer wardrobe in this box here, but it would be very foolish to put it on now.
Here I am.
On Sundays I go out walking in shoes and white silk stockings, and a muff."
After him, a lady stepped out of the coach.
She called herself Miss MAY.
She wore a summer dress and overshoes; her dress was a light green, and she wore anemones in her hair.
She was so scented with wild-thyme, that it made the sentry sneeze.
"Your health, and God bless you," was her salutation to him.
How pretty she was! and such a singer! not a theatre singer, nor a ballad singer; no, but a singer of the woods; for she wandered through the gay green forest, and had a concert there for her own amusement.
"Now comes the young lady," said those in the carriage; and out stepped a young dame, delicate, proud, and pretty.
It was Mistress JUNE, in whose service people become lazy and fond of sleeping for hours.
She gives a feast on the longest day of the year, that there may be time for her guests to partake of the numerous dishes at her table.
Indeed, she keeps her own carriage; but still she travelled by the mail, with the rest, because she wished to show that she was not high-minded.
But she was not without a protector; her younger brother, JULY, was with her.
He was a plump young fellow, clad in summer garments and wearing a straw hat.
He had but very little luggage with him, because it was so cumbersome in the great heat; he had, however, swimming-trousers with him, which are nothing to carry.
Then came the mother herself, in crinoline, Madame AUGUST, a wholesale dealer in fruit, proprietress of a large number of fish ponds and a land cultivator.
She was fat and heated, yet she could use her hands well, and would herself carry out beer to the laborers in the field.
"In the sweat of the face shalt thou eat bread," said she; "it is written in the Bible."
After work, came the recreations, dancing and playing in the greenwood, and the "harvest homes."
She was a thorough housewife.
After her a man came out of the coach, who is a painter; he is the great master of colors, and is named SEPTEMBER.
The forest, on his arrival, had to change its colors when he wished it; and how beautiful are the colors he chooses!
The woods glow with hues of red and gold and brown.
This great master painter could whistle like a blackbird.
He was quick in his work, and soon entwined the tendrils of the hop plant around his beer jug.
This was an ornament to the jug, and he has a great love for ornament.
There he stood with his color pot in his hand, and that was the whole of his luggage.
A land-owner followed, who in the month for sowing seed attended to the ploughing and was fond of field sports.
Squire OCTOBER brought his dog and his gun with him, and had nuts in his game bag.
"Crack, crack."
He had a great deal of luggage, even an English plough.
He spoke of farming, but what he said could scarcely be heard for the coughing and gasping of his neighbor.
It was NOVEMBER, who coughed violently as he got out.
He had a cold, which caused him to use his pocket-handkerchief continually; and yet he said he was obliged to accompany servant girls to their new places, and initiate them into their winter service.
He said he thought his cold would never leave him when he went out woodcutting, for he was a master sawyer, and had to supply wood to the whole parish.
He spent his evenings preparing wooden soles for skates, for he knew, he said, that in a few weeks these shoes would be wanted for the amusement of skating.
At length the last passenger made her appearance,- old Mother DECEMBER, with her fire-stool.
The dame was very old, but her eyes glistened like two stars.
She carried on her arm a flower-pot, in which a little fir-tree was growing.
"This tree I shall guard and cherish," she said, "that it may grow large by Christmas Eve, and reach from the ground to the ceiling, to be covered and adorned with flaming candles, golden apples, and little figures.
The fire-stool will be as warm as a stove, and I shall then bring a story book out of my pocket, and read aloud till all the children in the room are quite quiet.
Then the little figures on the tree will become lively, and the little waxen angel at the top spread out his wings of gold-leaf, and fly down from his green perch.
He will kiss every one in the room, great and small; yes, even the poor children who stand in the passage, or out in the street singing a carol about the 'Star of Bethlehem.'"
"Well, now the coach may drive away," said the sentry; "we have the whole twelve.
Let the horses be put up."
"First, let all the twelve come to me," said the captain on duty, "one after another.
The passports I will keep here.
Each of them is available for one month; when that has passed, I shall write the behavior of each on his passport.
Mr. JANUARY, have the goodness to come here."
And Mr. January stepped forward.
When a year has passed, I think I shall be able to tell you what the twelve passengers have brought to you, to me, and to all of us.
Now I do not know, and probably even they don't know themselves, for we live in strange times.
IN the city of Florence, not far from the Piazza del Granduca, runs a little street called Porta Rosa.
In this street, just in front of the market-place where vegetables are sold, stands a pig, made of brass and curiously formed.
The bright color has been changed by age to dark green; but clear, fresh water pours from the snout, which shines as if it had been polished, and so indeed it has, for hundreds of poor people and children seize it in their hands as they place their mouths close to the mouth of the animal, to drink.
It is quite a picture to see a half-naked boy clasping the well-formed creature by the head, as he presses his rosy lips against its jaws.
Every one who visits Florence can very quickly find the place; he has only to ask the first beggar he meets for the Metal Pig, and he will be told where it is.
It was late on a winter evening; the mountains were covered with snow, but the moon shone brightly, and moonlight in Italy is like a dull winter's day in the north; indeed it is better, for clear air seems to raise us above the earth, while in the north a cold, gray, leaden sky appears to press us down to earth, even as the cold damp earth shall one day press on us in the grave.
In the garden of the grand duke's palace, under the roof of one of the wings, where a thousand roses bloom in winter, a little ragged boy had been sitting the whole day long; a boy, who might serve as a type of Italy, lovely and smiling, and yet still suffering.
He was hungry and thirsty, yet no one gave him anything; and when it became dark, and they were about to close the gardens, the porter turned him out.
He stood a long time musing on the bridge which crosses the Arno, and looking at the glittering stars, reflected in the water which flowed between him and the elegant marble bridge Della Trinita.
He then walked away towards the Metal Pig, half knelt down, clasped it with his arms, and then put his mouth to the shining snout and drank deep draughts of the fresh water.
Close by, lay a few salad-leaves and two chestnuts, which were to serve for his supper.
No one was in the street but himself; it belonged only to him, so he boldly seated himself on the pig's back, leaned forward so that his curly head could rest on the head of the animal, and, before he was aware, he fell asleep.
It was midnight.
The Metal Pig raised himself gently, and the boy heard him say quite distinctly, "Hold tight, little boy, for I am going to run;" and away he started for a most wonderful ride.
First, they arrived at the Piazza del Granduca, and the metal horse which bears the duke's statue, neighed aloud.
The painted coats-of-arms on the old council-house shone like transparent pictures, and Michael Angelo's David tossed his sling; it was as if everything had life.
The metallic groups of figures, among which were Perseus and the Rape of the Sabines, looked like living persons, and cries of terror sounded from them all across the noble square.
By the Palazzo degli Uffizi, in the arcade, where the nobility assemble for the carnival, the Metal Pig stopped.
"Hold fast," said the animal; "hold fast, for I am going up stairs."
The little boy said not a word; he was half pleased and half afraid.
They entered a long gallery, where the boy had been before.
The walls were resplendent with paintings; here stood statues and busts, all in a clear light as if it were day.
But the grandest appeared when the door of a side room opened; the little boy could remember what beautiful things he had seen there, but to-night everything shone in its brightest colors.
Here stood the figure of a beautiful woman, as beautifully sculptured as possible by one of the great masters.
Her graceful limbs appeared to move; dolphins sprang at her feet, and immortality shone from her eyes.
The world called her the Venus de' Medici.
By her side were statues, in which the spirit of life breathed in stone; figures of men, one of whom whetted his sword, and was named the Grinder; wrestling gladiators formed another group, the sword had been sharpened for them, and they strove for the goddess of beauty.
The boy was dazzled by so much glitter; for the walls were gleaming with bright colors, all appeared living reality.
As they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed itself; and as the Metal Pig went step by step from one picture to the other, the little boy could see it all plainly.
One glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight.
Many pass this picture by with indifference, and yet it contains a treasure of poetic feeling; it represents Christ descending into Hades.
They are not the lost whom the spectator sees, but the heathen of olden times.
The Florentine, Angiolo Bronzino, painted this picture; most beautiful is the expression on the face of the two children, who appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at last.
They are embracing each other, and one little one stretches out his hand towards another who stands below him, and points to himself, as if he were saying, "I am going to heaven."
The older people stand as if uncertain, yet hopeful, and they bow in humble adoration to the Lord Jesus.
On this picture the boy's eyes rested longer than on any other: the Metal Pig stood still before it.
A low sigh was heard.
Did it come from the picture or from the animal?
The boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the Pig ran off with him through the open vestibule.
"Thank you, thank you, you beautiful animal," said the little boy, caressing the Metal Pig as it ran down the steps.
"Thanks to yourself also," replied the Metal Pig; "I have helped you and you have helped me, for it is only when I have an innocent child on my back that I receive the power to run.
Yes; as you see, I can even venture under the rays of the lamp, in front of the picture of the Madonna, but I may not enter the church; still from without, and while you are upon my back, I may look in through the open door.
Do not get down yet, for if you do, then I shall be lifeless, as you have seen me in the Porta Rosa."
"I will stay with you, my dear creature," said the little boy.
So then they went on at a rapid pace through the streets of Florence, till they came to the square before the church of Santa Croce.
The folding-doors flew open, and light streamed from the altar through the church into the deserted square.
A wonderful blaze of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side aisle, and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it; even the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and a red ladder on a blue field gleamed like fire.
It was the grave of Galileo.
The monument is unadorned, but the red ladder is an emblem of art, signifying that the way to glory leads up a shining ladder, on which the prophets of mind rise to heaven, like Elias of old.
In the right aisle of the church every statue on the richly carved sarcophagi seemed endowed with life.
Here stood Michael Angelo; there Dante, with the laurel wreath round his brow; Alfieri and Machiavelli; for here side by side rest the great men- the pride of Italy.
The church itself is very beautiful, even more beautiful than the marble cathedral at Florence, though not so large.
It seemed as if the carved vestments stirred, and as if the marble figures they covered raised their heads higher, to gaze upon the brightly colored glowing altar where the white-robed boys swung the golden censers, amid music and song, while the strong fragrance of incense filled the church, and streamed forth into the square.
The boy stretched forth his hands towards the light, and at the same moment the Metal Pig started again so rapidly that he was obliged to cling tightly to him.
The wind whistled in his ears, he heard the church door creak on its hinges as it closed, and it seemed to him as if he had lost his senses- then a cold shudder passed over him, and he awoke.
It was morning; the Metal Pig stood in its old place on the Porta Rosa, and the boy found he had slipped nearly off its back.
Fear and trembling came upon him as he thought of his mother; she had sent him out the day before to get some money, he had not done so, and now he was hungry and thirsty.
Once more he clasped the neck of his metal horse, kissed its nose, and nodded farewell to it.
Then he wandered away into one of the narrowest streets, where there was scarcely room for a loaded donkey to pass.
A great iron-bound door stood ajar; he passed through, and climbed up a brick staircase, with dirty walls and a rope for a balustrade, till he came to an open gallery hung with rags.
From here a flight of steps led down to a court, where from a well water was drawn up by iron rollers to the different stories of the house, and where the water-buckets hung side by side.
Sometimes the roller and the bucket danced in the air, splashing the water all over the court.
Another broken-down staircase led from the gallery, and two Russian sailors running down it almost upset the poor boy.
They were coming from their nightly carousal.
A woman not very young, with an unpleasant face and a quantity of black hair, followed them.
"What have you brought home?" she asked. when she saw the boy.
"Don't be angry," he pleaded; "I received nothing, I have nothing at all;" and he seized his mother's dress and would have kissed it.
Then they went into a little room.
I need not describe it, but only say that there stood in it an earthen pot with handles, made for holding fire, which in Italy is called a marito.
This pot she took in her lap, warmed her fingers, and pushed the boy with her elbow.
"Certainly you must have some money," she said.
The boy began to cry, and then she struck him with her foot till he cried out louder.
"Will you be quiet? or I'll break your screaming head;" and she swung about the fire-pot which she held in her hand, while the boy crouched to the earth and screamed.
Then a neighbor came in, and she had also a marito under her arm.
"Felicita," she said, "what are you doing to the child?"
"The child is mine," she answered; "I can murder him if I like, and you too, Giannina."
And then she swung about the fire-pot.
The other woman lifted up hers to defend herself, and the two pots clashed together so violently that they were dashed to pieces, and fire and ashes flew about the room.
The boy rushed out at the sight, sped across the courtyard, and fled from the house.
The poor child ran till he was quite out of breath; at last he stopped at the church, the doors of which were opened to him the night before, and went in.
Here everything was bright, and the boy knelt down by the first tomb on his right, the grave of Michael Angelo, and sobbed as if his heart would break.
People came and went, mass was performed, but no one noticed the boy, excepting an elderly citizen, who stood still and looked at him for a moment, and then went away like the rest.
Hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill.
At last he crept into a corner behind the marble monuments, and went to sleep.
Towards evening he was awakened by a pull at his sleeve; he started up, and the same old citizen stood before him.
"Are you ill? where do you live? have you been here all day?" were some of the questions asked by the old man.
After hearing his answers, the old man took him home to a small house close by, in a back street.
They entered a glovemaker's shop, where a woman sat sewing busily.
A little white poodle, so closely shaven that his pink skin could plainly be seen, frisked about the room, and gambolled upon the boy.
"Innocent souls are soon intimate," said the woman, as she caressed both the boy and the dog.
These good people gave the child food and drink, and said he should stay with them all night, and that the next day the old man, who was called Giuseppe, would go and speak to his mother.
A little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the Metal Pig.
Giuseppe went out the next morning, and the poor child was not glad to see him go, for he knew that the old man was gone to his mother, and that, perhaps, he would have to go back.
He wept at the thought, and then he played with the little, lively dog, and kissed it, while the old woman looked kindly at him to encourage him.
And what news did Giuseppe bring back?
At first the boy could not hear, for he talked a great deal to his wife, and she nodded and stroked the boy's cheek.
Then she said, "He is a good lad, he shall stay with us, he may become a clever glovemaker, like you.
Look what delicate fingers he has got; Madonna intended him for a glovemaker."
So the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry.
But at last he began to tease Bellissima, as the little dog was called.
This made the woman angry, and she scolded him and threatened him, which made him very unhappy, and he went and sat in his own room full of sad thoughts.
This chamber looked upon the street, in which hung skins to dry, and there were thick iron bars across his window.
That night he lay awake, thinking of the Metal Pig; indeed, it was always in his thoughts.
Suddenly he fancied he heard feet outside going pit-a-pat.
He sprung out of bed and went to the window.
Could it be the Metal Pig?
But there was nothing to be seen; whatever he had heard had passed already.
Next morning, their neighbor, the artist, passed by, carrying a paint-box and a large roll of canvas.
"Help the gentleman to carry his box of colors," said the woman to the boy; and he obeyed instantly, took the box, and followed the painter.
They walked on till they reached the picture gallery, and mounted the same staircase up which he had ridden that night on the Metal Pig.
He remembered all the statues and pictures, the beautiful marble Venus, and again he looked at the Madonna with the Saviour and St. John.
They stopped before the picture by Bronzino, in which Christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the children smiling before Him, in the sweet expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven.
"You may go home now," said the painter, while the boy stood watching him, till he had set up his easel.
"May I see you paint?" asked the boy; "may I see you put the picture on this white canvas?"
"I am not going to paint yet," replied the artist; then he brought out a piece of chalk.
His hand moved quickly, and his eye measured the great picture; and though nothing appeared but a faint line, the figure of the Saviour was as clearly visible as in the colored picture.
"Why don't you go?" said the painter.
Then the boy wandered home silently, and seated himself on the table, and learned to sew gloves.
But all day long his thoughts were in the picture gallery; and so he pricked his fingers and was awkward.
But he did not tease Bellissima.
When evening came, and the house door stood open, he slipped out.
It was a bright, beautiful, starlight evening, but rather cold.
Away he went through the already-deserted streets, and soon came to the Metal Pig; he stooped down and kissed its shining nose, and then seated himself on its back.
"You happy creature," he said; "how I have longed for you! we must take a ride to-night."
But the Metal Pig lay motionless, while the fresh stream gushed forth from its mouth.
The little boy still sat astride on its back, when he felt something pulling at his clothes.
He looked down, and there was Bellissima, little smooth-shaven Bellissima, barking as if she would have said, "Here I am too; why are you sitting there?"
A fiery dragon could not have frightened the little boy so much as did the little dog in this place.
"Bellissima in the street, and not dressed!" as the old lady called it; "what would be the end of this?"
The dog never went out in winter, unless she was attired in a little lambskin coat which had been made for her; it was fastened round the little dog's neck and body with red ribbons, and was decorated with rosettes and little bells.
The dog looked almost like a little kid when she was allowed to go out in winter, and trot after her mistress.
And now here she was in the cold, and not dressed.
Oh, how would it end?
All his fancies were quickly put to flight; yet he kissed the Metal Pig once more, and then took Bellissima in his arms.
The poor little thing trembled so with cold, that the boy ran homeward as fast as he could.
"What are you running away with there?" asked two of the police whom he met, and at whom the dog barked.
"Where have you stolen that pretty dog?" they asked; and they took it away from him.
"Oh, I have not stolen it; do give it to me back again," cried the boy, despairingly.
"If you have not stolen it, you may say at home that they can send to the watch-house for the dog."
Then they told him where the watch-house was, and went away with Bellissima.
Here was a dreadful trouble.
The boy did not know whether he had better jump into the Arno, or go home and confess everything.
They would certainly kill him, he thought.
"Well, I would gladly be killed," he reasoned; "for then I shall die, and go to heaven:" and so he went home, almost hoping for death.
The door was locked, and he could not reach the knocker.
No one was in the street; so he took up a stone, and with it made a tremendous noise at the door.
"Who is there?" asked somebody from within.
"It is I," said he.
"Bellissima is gone.
Open the door, and then kill me."
Then indeed there was a great panic.
Madame was so very fond of Bellissima.
She immediately looked at the wall where the dog's dress usually hung; and there was the little lambskin.
"Bellissima in the watch-house!" she cried.
"You bad boy! how did you entice her out?
Poor little delicate thing, with those rough policemen! and she'll be frozen with cold."
Giuseppe went off at once, while his wife lamented, and the boy wept.
Several of the neighbors came in, and amongst them the painter.
He took the boy between his knees, and questioned him; and, in broken sentences, he soon heard the whole story, and also about the Metal Pig, and the wonderful ride to the picture-gallery, which was certainly rather incomprehensible.
The painter, however, consoled the little fellow, and tried to soften the lady's anger; but she would not be pacified till her husband returned with Bellissima, who had been with the police.
Then there was great rejoicing, and the painter caressed the boy, and gave him a number of pictures.
Oh, what beautiful pictures these were!- figures with funny heads; and, above all, the Metal Pig was there too.
Oh, nothing could be more delightful.
By means of a few strokes, it was made to appear on the paper; and even the house that stood behind it had been sketched in.
Oh, if he could only draw and paint!
He who could do this could conjure all the world before him.
The first leisure moment during the next day, the boy got a pencil, and on the back of one of the other drawings he attempted to copy the drawing of the Metal Pig, and he succeeded.
Certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done.
The pencil would not go quite as it ought,- he had found that out; but the next day he tried again.
A second pig was drawn by the side of the first, and this looked a hundred times better; and the third attempt was so good, that everybody might know what it was meant to represent.
And now the glovemaking went on but slowly.
The orders given by the shops in the town were not finished quickly; for the Metal Pig had taught the boy that all objects may be drawn upon paper; and Florence is a picture-book in itself for any one who chooses to turn over its pages.
On the Piazza dell Trinita stands a slender pillar, and upon it is the goddess of Justice, blindfolded, with her scales in her hand.
She was soon represented on paper, and it was the glovemaker's boy who placed her there.
His collection of pictures increased; but as yet they were only copies of lifeless objects, when one day Bellissima came gambolling before him: "Stand still," cried he, "and I will draw you beautifully, to put amongst my collection."
But Bellissima would not stand still, so she must be bound fast in one position.
He tied her head and tail; but she barked and jumped, and so pulled and tightened the string, that she was nearly strangled; and just then her mistress walked in.
"You wicked boy! the poor little creature!" was all she could utter.
She pushed the boy from her, thrust him away with her foot, called him a most ungrateful, good-for-nothing, wicked boy, and forbade him to enter the house again.
Then she wept, and kissed her little half-strangled Bellissima.
At this moment the painter entered the room.
* * * * * * *
In the year 1834 there was an exhibition in the Academy of Arts at Florence.
Two pictures, placed side by side, attracted a large number of spectators.
The smaller of the two represented a little boy sitting at a table, drawing; before him was a little white poodle, curiously shaven; but as the animal would not stand still, it had been fastened with a string to its head and tail, to keep it in one position.
The truthfulness and life in this picture interested every one.
The painter was said to be a young Florentine, who had been found in the streets, when a child, by an old glovemaker, who had brought him up.
The boy had taught himself to draw: it was also said that a young artist, now famous, had discovered talent in the child just as he was about to be sent away for having tied up madame's favorite little dog, and using it as a model.
The glovemaker's boy had also become a great painter, as the picture proved; but the larger picture by its side was a still greater proof of his talent.
It represented a handsome boy, clothed in rags, lying asleep, and leaning against the Metal Pig in the street of the Porta Rosa.
All the spectators knew the spot well.
The child's arms were round the neck of the Pig, and he was in a deep sleep.
The lamp before the picture of the Madonna threw a strong, effective light on the pale, delicate face of the child.
It was a beautiful picture.
A large gilt frame surrounded it, and on one corner of the frame a laurel wreath had been hung; but a black band, twined unseen among the green leaves, and a streamer of crape, hung down from it; for within the last few days the young artist had- died.
IN a nursery where a number of toys lay scattered about, a money-box stood on the top of a very high wardrobe.
It was made of clay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought of the potter.
In the back of the pig was a slit, and this slit had been enlarged with a knife, so that dollars, or crown pieces, might slip through; and, indeed there were two in the box, besides a number of pence.
The money-pig was stuffed so full that it could no longer rattle, which is the highest state of perfection to which a money-pig can attain.
There he stood upon the cupboard, high and lofty, looking down upon everything else in the room.
He knew very well that he had enough inside him to buy up all the other toys, and this gave him a very good opinion of his own value.
The rest thought of this fact also, although they did not express it, for there were so many other things to talk about.
A large doll, still handsome, though rather old, for her neck had been mended, lay inside one of the drawers which was partly open.
She called out to the others, "Let us have a game at being men and women, that is something worth playing at."
Upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings, which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement, and showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had not the least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to object to the game.
It was late at night, but as the moon shone through the windows, they had light at a cheap rate.
And as the game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children's wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings.
"Each has its own value," said the wagon; "we cannot all be noblemen; there must be some to do the work."
The money-pig was the only one who received a written invitation.
He stood so high that they were afraid he would not accept a verbal message.
But in his reply, he said, if he had to take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home; they were to arrange for him to do so; and so they did.
The little toy theatre was therefore put up in such a way that the money-pig could look directly into it.
Some wanted to begin with a comedy, and afterwards to have a tea party and a discussion for mental improvement, but they commenced with the latter first.
The rocking-horse spoke of training and races; the wagon of railways and steam power, for these subjects belonged to each of their professions, and it was right they should talk of them.
The clock talked politics- "tick, tick;" he professed to know what was the time of day, but there was a whisper that he did not go correctly.
The bamboo cane stood by, looking stiff and proud: he was vain of his brass ferrule and silver top, and on the sofa lay two worked cushions, pretty but stupid.
When the play at the little theatre began, the rest sat and looked on; they were requested to applaud and stamp, or crack, when they felt gratified with what they saw.
But the riding-whip said he never cracked for old people, only for the young who were not yet married.
"I crack for everybody," said the cracker.
"Yes, and a fine noise you make," thought the audience, as the play went on.
It was not worth much, but it was very well played, and all the characters turned their painted sides to the audience, for they were made only to be seen on one side.
The acting was wonderful, excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps, because the wires were a little too long.
The doll, whose neck had been darned, was so excited that the place in her neck burst, and the money-pig declared he must do something for one of the players, as they had all pleased him so much.
So he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him in the family vault, whenever that event should happen.
They all enjoyed the comedy so much, that they gave up all thoughts of the tea party, and only carried out their idea of intellectual amusement, which they called playing at men and women; and there was nothing wrong about it, for it was only play.
All the while, each one thought most of himself, or of what the money-pig could be thinking.
His thoughts were on, as he supposed, a very distant time- of making his will, and of his burial, and of when it might all come to pass.
Certainly sooner than he expected- for all at once down he came from the top of the press, fell on the ground, and was broken to pieces.
Then the pennies hopped and danced about in the most amusing manner.
The little ones twirled round like tops, and the large ones rolled away as far as they could, especially the one great silver crown piece who had often to go out into the world, and now he had his wish as well as all the rest of the money.
The pieces of the money-pig were thrown into the dust-bin, and the next day there stood a new money-pig on the cupboard, but it had not a farthing in its inside yet, and therefore, like the old one, it could not rattle.
This was the beginning with him, and we will make it the end of our story.
ONE would have thought that something important was going on in the duck-pond, but it was nothing after all.
All the ducks lying quietly on the water or standing on their heads in it- for they could do that- at once swarm to the sides; the traces of their feet were seen in the wet earth, and their cackling was heard far and wide.
The water, which a few moments before had been as clear and smooth as a mirror, became very troubled.
Before, every tree, every neighbouring bush, the old farmhouse with the holes in the roof and the swallows' nest, and especially the great rose-bush full of flowers, had been reflected in it.
The rose-bush covered the wall and hung out over the water, in which everything was seen as if in a picture, except that it all stood on its head; but when the water was troubled everything got mixed up, and the picture was gone.
Two feathers which the fluttering ducks had lost floated up and down; suddenly they took a rush as if the wind were coming, but as it did not come they had to lie still, and the water once more became quiet and smooth.
The roses were again reflected; they were very beautiful, but they did not know it, for no one had told them.
The sun shone among the delicate leaves; everything breathed forth the loveliest fragrance, and all felt as we do when we are filled with joy at the thought of our happiness.
"How beautiful existence is!" said each rose.
"The only thing that I wish for is to be able to kiss the sun, because it is so warm and bright.
I should also like to kiss those roses down in the water, which are so much like us, and the pretty little birds down in the nest.
There are some up above too; they put out their heads and pipe softly; they have no feathers like their father and mother.
We have good neighbours, both below and above.
How beautiful existence is!"
The young ones above and below- those below were really only shadows in the water- were sparrows; their parents were sparrows too, and had taken possession of the empty swallows' nest of last year, and now lived in it as if it were their own property.
"Are those the duck's children swimming here?" asked the young sparrows when they saw the feathers on the water.
"If you must ask questions, ask sensible ones," said their mother.
"Don't you see that they are feathers, such as I wear and you will wear too?
But ours are finer.
Still, I should like to have them up in the nest, for they keep one warm.
I am very curious to know what the ducks were so startled about; not about us, certainly, although I did say 'peep' to you pretty loudly.
The thick-headed roses ought to know why, but they know nothing at all; they only look at themselves and smell.
I am heartily tired of such neighbours."
"Listen to the dear little birds up there," said the roses; "they begin to want to sing too, but are not able to manage it yet.
But it will soon come.
What a pleasure that must be!
It is fine to have such cheerful neighbours."
Suddenly two horses came galloping up to be watered.
A peasant boy rode on one, and he had taken off all his clothes except his large broad black hat.
The boy whistled like a bird, and rode into the pond where it was deepest, and as he passed the rose-bush he plucked a rose and stuck it in his hat.
Now he looked dressed, and rode on.
The other roses looked after their sister, and asked each other, "Where can she be going to?"
But none of them knew.
"I should like to go out into the world for once," said one; "but here at home among our green leaves it is beautiful too.
The whole day long the sun shines bright and warm, and in the night the sky shines more beautifully still; we can see that through all the little holes in it."
They meant the stars, but they knew no better.
"We make it lively about the house," said the sparrow-mother; "and people say that a swallows' nest brings luck; so they are glad of us.
But such neighbours as ours!
A rose-bush on the wall like that causes damp.
I daresay it will be taken away; then we shall, perhaps, have some corn growing here.
The roses are good for nothing but to be looked at and to be smelt, or at most to be stuck in a hat.
Every year, as I have been told by my mother, they fall off.
The farmer's wife preserves them and strews salt among them; then they get a French name which I neither can pronounce nor care to, and are put into the fire to make a nice smell.
You see, that's their life; they exist only for the eye and the nose.
Now you know."
In the evening, when the gnats were playing about in the warm air and in the red clouds, the nightingale came and sang to the roses that the beautiful was like sunshine to the world, and that the beautiful lived for ever.
The roses thought that the nightingale was singing about itself, and that one might easily have believed; they had no idea that the song was about them.
But they were very pleased with it, and wondered whether all the little sparrows could become nightingales.
"I understand the song of that bird very well," said the young sparrows.
"There was only one word that was not clear to me.
What does 'the beautiful' mean?"
"Nothing at all," answered their mother; "that's only something external.
Up at the Hall, where the pigeons have their own house, and corn and peas are strewn before them every day- I have dined with them myself, and that you shall do in time, too; for tell me what company you keep and I'll tell you who you are- up at the Hall they have two birds with green necks and a crest upon their heads; they can spread out their tails like a great wheel, and these are so bright with various colours that it makes one's eyes ache.
These birds are called peacocks, and that is 'the beautiful.'
If they were only plucked a little they would look no better than the rest of us.
I would have plucked them already if they had not been so big."
"I'll pluck them," piped the young sparrow, who had no feathers yet.
In the farmhouse lived a young married couple; they loved each other dearly, were industrious and active, and everything in their home looked very nice.
On Sundays the young wife came down early, plucked a handful of the most beautiful roses, and put them into a glass of water, which she placed upon the cupboard.
"Now I see that it is Sunday," said the husband, kissing his little wife.
They sat down, read their hymn-book, and held each other by the hand, while the sun shone down upon the fresh roses and upon them.
"This sight is really too tedious," said the sparrow-mother, who could see into the room from her nest; and she flew away.
The same thing happened on the following Sunday, for every Sunday fresh roses were put into the glass; but the rose-bush bloomed as beautifully as ever.
The young sparrows now had feathers, and wanted very much to fly with their mother; but she would not allow it, and so they had to stay at home.
In one of her flights, however it may have happened, she was caught, before she was aware of it, in a horse-hair net which some boys had attached to a tree.
The horse-hair was drawn tightly round her leg- as tightly as if the latter were to be cut off; she was in great pain and terror.
The boys came running up and seized her, and in no gentle way either.
"It's only a sparrow," they said; they did not, however, let her go, but took her home with them, and every time she cried they hit her on the beak.
In the farmhouse was an old man who understood making soap into cakes and balls, both for shaving and washing.
He was a merry old man, always wandering about.
On seeing the sparrow which the boys had brought, and which they said they did not want, he asked, "Shall we make it look very pretty?"
At these words an icy shudder ran through the sparrow-mother.
Out of his box, in which were the most beautiful colours, the old man took a quantity of shining leaf-gold, while the boys had to go and fetch some white of egg, with which the sparrow was to be smeared all over; the gold was stuck on to this, and the sparrow-mother was now gilded all over.
But she, trembling in every limb, did not think of the adornment.
Then the soap-man tore off a small piece from the red lining of his old jacket, and cutting it so as to make it look like a cock's comb, he stuck it to the bird's head.
"Now you will see the gold-jacket fly," said the old man, letting the sparrow go, which flew away in deadly fear, with the sun shining upon her.
How she glittered!
All the sparrows, and even a crow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was.
Driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was almost sinking fainting to the earth, while the flock of pursuing birds increased, some even attempting to peck at her.
"Look at her!
Look at her!" they all cried.
"Look at her!
Look at her" cried her little ones. as she approached the nest.
"That is certainly a young peacock, for it glitters in all colours; it makes one's eyes ache, as mother told us.
Peep! that's 'the beautiful'."
And then they pecked at the bird with their little beaks so that it was impossible for her to get into the nest; she was so exhausted that she couldn't even say "Peep!" much less "I am your own mother!"
The other birds, too, now fell upon the sparrow and plucked off feather after feather until she fell bleeding into the rose-bush.
"Poor creature!" said all the roses; "only be still, and we will hide you.
Lean your little head against us.
The sparrow spread out her wings once more, then drew them closely to her, and lay dead near the neighbouring family, the beautiful fresh roses.
"Peep!" sounded from the nest.
"Where can mother be so long?
It's more than I can understand.
It cannot be a trick of hers, and mean that we are now to take care of ourselves.
She has left us the house as an inheritance; but to which of us is it to belong when we have families of our own?"
"Yes, it won't do for you to stay with me when I increase my household with a wife and children,"' said the smallest.
"I daresay I shall have more wives and children than you," said the second.
"But I am the eldest!" exclaimed the third.
Then they all got excited; they hit out with their wings, pecked with their beaks, and flop! one after another was thrown out of the nest.
There they lay with their anger, holding their heads on one side and blinking the eye that was turned upwards.
That was their way of looking foolish.
They could fly a little; by practice they learned to improve, and at last they agreed upon a sign by which to recognise each other if they should meet in the world later on.
It was to be one "Peep!" and three scratches on the ground with the left foot.
The young one who had remained behind in the nest made himself as broad as he could, for he was the proprietor.
But this greatness did not last long.
In the night the red flames burst through the window and seized the roof, the dry straw blazed up high, and the whole house, together with the young sparrow, was burned.
The two others, who wanted to marry, thus saved their lives by a stroke of luck.
When the sun rose again and everything looked as refreshed as if it had had a quiet sleep, there only remained of the farmhouse a few black charred beams leaning against the chimney, which was now its own master.
Thick smoke still rose from the ruins, but the rose-bush stood yonder, fresh, blooming, and untouched, every flower and every twig being reflected in the clear water.
"How beautifully the roses bloom before the ruined house," exclaimed a passer-by.
"A pleasanter picture cannot be imagined.
I must have that."
And the man took out of his portfolio a little book with white leaves: he was a painter, and with his pencil he drew the smoking house, the charred beams and the overhanging chimney, which bent more and more; in the foreground he put the large, blooming rose-bush, which presented a charming view.
For its sake alone the whole picture had been drawn.
Later in the day the two sparrows who had been born there came by.
"Where is the house?" they asked.
"Where is the nest?
Peep!
All is burned and our strong brother too.
That's what he has now for keeping the nest.
The roses got off very well; there they still stand with their red cheeks.
They certainly do not mourn at their neighbours' misfortunes.
I don't want to talk to them, and it looks miserable here- that's my opinion."
And away they went.
On a beautiful sunny autumn day- one could almost have believed it was still the middle of summer- there hopped about in the dry clean-swept courtyard before the principal entrance of the Hall a number of black, white, and gaily-coloured pigeons, all shining in the sunlight.
The pigeon-mothers said to their young ones: "Stand in groups, stand in groups! for that looks much better."
"What kind of creatures are those little grey ones that run about behind us?" asked an old pigeon, with red and green in her eyes.
"Little grey ones!
Little grey ones!" she cried.
"They are sparrows, and good creatures.
We have always had the reputation of being pious, so we will allow them to pick up the corn with us; they don't interrupt our talk, and they scrape so prettily when they bow."
Indeed they were continually making three foot-scrapings with the left foot and also said "Peep!"
By this means they recognised each other, for they were the sparrows from the nest on the burned house.
"Here is excellent fare!" said the sparrow.
The pigeons strutted round one another, puffed out their chests mightily, and had their own private views and opinions.
"Do you see that pouter pigeon?" said one to the other.
"Do you see how she swallows the peas?
She eats too many, and the best ones too.
Curoo!
Curoo!
How she lifts her crest, the ugly, spiteful creature!
Curoo!
Curoo!"
And the eyes of all sparkled with malice.
"Stand in groups!
Stand in groups!
Little grey ones, little grey ones!
Curoo, curoo, curoo!"
So their chatter ran on, and so it will run on for thousands of years.
The sparrows ate lustily; they listened attentively, and even stood in the ranks with the others, but it did not suit them at all.
They were full, and so they left the pigeons, exchanging opinions about them, slipped in under the garden palings, and when they found the door leading into the house open, one of them, who was more than full, and therefore felt brave, hopped on to the threshold.
"Peep!" said he; "I may venture that."
"Peep!" said the other; "so may I, and something more too!" and he hopped into the room.
No one was there; the third sparrow, seeing this, flew still farther into the room, exclaiming, "All or nothing!
It is a curious man's nest all the same; and what have they put up here?
What is it?"
Close to the sparrows the roses were blooming; they were reflected in the water, and the charred beams leaned against the overhanging chimney.
"Do tell me what this is.
How comes this in a room at the Hall?"
And all three sparrows wanted to fly over the roses and the chimney, but flew against a flat wall.
It was all a picture, a great splendid picture, which the artist had painted from a sketch.
"Peep!" said the sparrows, "it's nothing.
It only looks like something.
Peep! that is 'the beautiful.'
Do you understand it?
I don't."
And they flew away, for some people came into the room.
Days and years went by.
The pigeons had often cooed, not to say growled- the spiteful creatures; the sparrows had been frozen in winter and had lived merrily in summer: they were all betrothed, or married, or whatever you like to call it.
They had little ones, and of course each one thought his own the handsomest and cleverest; one flew this way, another that, and when they met they recognised each other by their "Peep!" and the three scrapes with the left foot.
The eldest had remained an old maid and had no nest nor young ones.
It was her pet idea to see a great city, so she flew to Copenhagen.
There was a large house painted in many gay colours standing close to the castle and the canal, upon which latter were to be seen many ships laden with apples and pottery.
The windows of the house were broader at the bottom than at the top, and when the sparrows looked through them, every room appeared to them like a tulip with the brightest colours and shades.
But in the middle of the tulip stood white men, made of marble; a few were of plaster; still, looked at with sparrows' eyes, that comes to the same thing.
Up on the roof stood a metal chariot drawn by metal horses, and the goddess of Victory, also of metal, was driving.
It was Thorwaldsen's Museum.
"How it shines! how it shines!" said the maiden sparrow.
"I suppose that is 'the beautiful.'
Peep!
But here it is larger than a peacock."
She still remembered what in her childhood's days her mother had looked upon as the greatest among the beautiful.
She flew down into the courtyard: there everything was extremely fine.
Palms and branches were painted on the walls, and in the middle of the court stood a great blooming rose-tree spreading out its fresh boughs, covered with roses, over a grave.
Thither flew the maiden sparrow, for she saw several of her own kind there.
A "peep" and three foot-scrapings- in this way she had often greeted throughout the year, and no one here had responded, for those who are once parted do not meet every day; and so this greeting had become a habit with her.
But to-day two old sparrows and a young one answered with a "peep" and the thrice-repeated scrape with the left foot.
"Ah!
Good-day! good-day!"
They were two old ones from the nest and a little one of the family.
"Do we meet here?
It's a grand place, but there's not much to eat.
This is 'the beautiful.'
Peep!"
Many people came out of the side rooms where the beautiful marble statues stood and approached the grave where lay the great master who had created these works of art.
All stood with enraptured faces round Thorwaldsen's grave, and a few picked up the fallen rose-leaves and preserved them.
They had come from afar: one from mighty England, others from Germany and France.
The fairest of the ladies plucked one of the roses and hid it in her bosom.
Then the sparrows thought that the roses reigned here, and that the house had been built for their sake.
That appeared to them to be really too much, but since all the people showed their love for the roses, they did not wish to be behindhand.
"Peep!" they said sweeping the ground with their tails, and blinking with one eye at the roses, they had not looked at them long before they were convinced that they were their old neighbours.
And so they really were.
The painter who had drawn the rose-bush near the ruined house, had afterwards obtained permission to dig it up, and had given it to the architect, for finer roses had never been seen.
The architect had planted it upon Thorwaldsen's grave, where it bloomed as an emblem of 'the beautiful' and yielded fragrant red rose-leaves to be carried as mementoes to distant lands.
"Have you obtained an appointment here in the city?" asked the sparrows.
The roses nodded; they recognized their grey neighbours and were pleased to see them again.
"How glorious it is to live and to bloom, to see old friends again, and happy faces every day.
It is as if every day were a festival."
"Peep!" said the sparrows.
"Yes, they are really our old neighbours; we remember their origin near the pond.
Peep! how they have got on.
Yes, some succeed while they are asleep.
Ah! there's a faded leaf; I can see that quite plainly."
And they pecked at it till it fell off.
But the tree stood there fresher and greener than ever; the roses bloomed in the sunshine on Thorwaldsen's grave and became associated with his immortal name.
IN China, you know, the emperor is a Chinese, and all those about him are Chinamen also.
The story I am going to tell you happened a great many years ago, so it is well to hear it now before it is forgotten.
The emperor's palace was the most beautiful in the world.
It was built entirely of porcelain, and very costly, but so delicate and brittle that whoever touched it was obliged to be careful.
In the garden could be seen the most singular flowers, with pretty silver bells tied to them, which tinkled so that every one who passed could not help noticing the flowers.
Indeed, everything in the emperor's garden was remarkable, and it extended so far that the gardener himself did not know where it ended.
Those who travelled beyond its limits knew that there was a noble forest, with lofty trees, sloping down to the deep blue sea, and the great ships sailed under the shadow of its branches.
In one of these trees lived a nightingale, who sang so beautifully that even the poor fishermen, who had so many other things to do, would stop and listen.
Sometimes, when they went at night to spread their nets, they would hear her sing, and say, "Oh, is not that beautiful?"
But when they returned to their fishing, they forgot the bird until the next night.
Then they would hear it again, and exclaim "Oh, how beautiful is the nightingale's song!"
Travellers from every country in the world came to the city of the emperor, which they admired very much, as well as the palace and gardens; but when they heard the nightingale, they all declared it to be the best of all.
And the travellers, on their return home, related what they had seen; and learned men wrote books, containing descriptions of the town, the palace, and the gardens; but they did not forget the nightingale, which was really the greatest wonder.
And those who could write poetry composed beautiful verses about the nightingale, who lived in a forest near the deep sea.
The books travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands of the emperor; and he sat in his golden chair, and, as he read, he nodded his approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city, his palace, and his gardens.
But when he came to the words, "the nightingale is the most beautiful of all," he exclaimed, "What is this?
I know nothing of any nightingale.
Is there such a bird in my empire? and even in my garden?
I have never heard of it.
Something, it appears, may be learnt from books."
Then he called one of his lords-in-waiting, who was so high-bred, that when any in an inferior rank to himself spoke to him, or asked him a question, he would answer, "Pooh," which means nothing.
"There is a very wonderful bird mentioned here, called a nightingale," said the emperor; "they say it is the best thing in my large kingdom.
Why have I not been told of it?"
"I have never heard the name," replied the cavalier; "she has not been presented at court."
"It is my pleasure that she shall appear this evening." said the emperor; the whole world knows what I possess better than I do myself."
"I have never heard of her," said the cavalier; "yet I will endeavor to find her."
But where was the nightingale to be found?
The nobleman went up stairs and down, through halls and passages; yet none of those whom he met had heard of the bird.
So he returned to the emperor, and said that it must be a fable, invented by those who had written the book.
"Your imperial majesty," said he, "cannot believe everything contained in books; sometimes they are only fiction, or what is called the black art."
"But the book in which I have read this account," said the emperor, "was sent to me by the great and mighty emperor of Japan, and therefore it cannot contain a falsehood.
I will hear the nightingale, she must be here this evening; she has my highest favor; and if she does not come, the whole court shall be trampled upon after supper is ended."
"Tsing-pe!" cried the lord-in-waiting, and again he ran up and down stairs, through all the halls and corridors; and half the court ran with him, for they did not like the idea of being trampled upon.
There was a great inquiry about this wonderful nightingale, whom all the world knew, but who was unknown to the court.
At last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen, who said, "Oh, yes, I know the nightingale quite well; indeed, she can sing.
Every evening I have permission to take home to my poor sick mother the scraps from the table; she lives down by the sea-shore, and as I come back I feel tired, and I sit down in the wood to rest, and listen to the nightingale's song.
Then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother kissed me."
"Little maiden," said the lord-in-waiting, "I will obtain for you constant employment in the kitchen, and you shall have permission to see the emperor dine, if you will lead us to the nightingale; for she is invited for this evening to the palace."
So she went into the wood where the nightingale sang, and half the court followed her.
As they went along, a cow began lowing.
"Oh," said a young courtier, "now we have found her; what wonderful power for such a small creature; I have certainly heard it before."
"No, that is only a cow lowing," said the little girl; "we are a long way from the place yet."
Then some frogs began to croak in the marsh.
"Beautiful," said the young courtier again.
"Now I hear it, tinkling like little church bells."
"No, those are frogs," said the little maiden; "but I think we shall soon hear her now:" and presently the nightingale began to sing.
"Hark, hark! there she is," said the girl, "and there she sits," she added, pointing to a little gray bird who was perched on a bough.
"Is it possible?" said the lord-in-waiting, "I never imagined it would be a little, plain, simple thing like that.
She has certainly changed color at seeing so many grand people around her."
"Little nightingale," cried the girl, raising her voice, "our most gracious emperor wishes you to sing before him."
"With the greatest pleasure," said the nightingale, and began to sing most delightfully.
"It sounds like tiny glass bells," said the lord-in-waiting, "and see how her little throat works.
It is surprising that we have never heard this before; she will be a great success at court."
"Shall I sing once more before the emperor?" asked the nightingale, who thought he was present.
"My excellent little nightingale," said the courtier, "I have the great pleasure of inviting you to a court festival this evening, where you will gain imperial favor by your charming song."
"My song sounds best in the green wood," said the bird; but still she came willingly when she heard the emperor's wish.
The palace was elegantly decorated for the occasion.
The walls and floors of porcelain glittered in the light of a thousand lamps.
Beautiful flowers, round which little bells were tied, stood in the corridors: what with the running to and fro and the draught, these bells tinkled so loudly that no one could speak to be heard.
In the centre of the great hall, a golden perch had been fixed for the nightingale to sit on.
The whole court was present, and the little kitchen-maid had received permission to stand by the door.
She was not installed as a real court cook.
All were in full dress, and every eye was turned to the little gray bird when the emperor nodded to her to begin.
The nightingale sang so sweetly that the tears came into the emperor's eyes, and then rolled down his cheeks, as her song became still more touching and went to every one's heart.
The emperor was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have his gold slipper to wear round her neck, but she declined the honor with thanks: she had been sufficiently rewarded already.
"I have seen tears in an emperor's eyes," she said, "that is my richest reward.
An emperor's tears have wonderful power, and are quite sufficient honor for me;" and then she sang again more enchantingly than ever.
"That singing is a lovely gift;" said the ladies of the court to each other; and then they took water in their mouths to make them utter the gurgling sounds of the nightingale when they spoke to any one, so thay they might fancy themselves nightingales.
And the footmen and chambermaids also expressed their satisfaction, which is saying a great deal, for they are very difficult to please.
In fact the nightingale's visit was most successful.
She was now to remain at court, to have her own cage, with liberty to go out twice a day, and once during the night.
Twelve servants were appointed to attend her on these occasions, who each held her by a silken string fastened to her leg.
There was certainly not much pleasure in this kind of flying.
The whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and when two people met, one said "nightin," and the other said "gale," and they understood what was meant, for nothing else was talked of.
Eleven peddlers' children were named after her, but not of them could sing a note.
One day the emperor received a large packet on which was written "The Nightingale."
"Here is no doubt a new book about our celebrated bird," said the emperor.
But instead of a book, it was a work of art contained in a casket, an artificial nightingale made to look like a living one, and covered all over with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires.
As soon as the artificial bird was wound up, it could sing like the real one, and could move its tail up and down, which sparkled with silver and gold.
Round its neck hung a piece of ribbon, on which was written "The Emperor of China's nightingale is poor compared with that of the Emperor of Japan's."
"This is very beautiful," exclaimed all who saw it, and he who had brought the artificial bird received the title of "Imperial nightingale-bringer-in-chief."
"Now they must sing together," said the court, "and what a duet it will be."
But they did not get on well, for the real nightingale sang in its own natural way, but the artificial bird sang only waltzes.
"That is not a fault," said the music-master, "it is quite perfect to my taste," so then it had to sing alone, and was as successful as the real bird; besides, it was so much prettier to look at, for it sparkled like bracelets and breast-pins.
Three and thirty times did it sing the same tunes without being tired; the people would gladly have heard it again, but the emperor said the living nightingale ought to sing something.
But where was she?
No one had noticed her when she flew out at the open window, back to her own green woods.
"What strange conduct," said the emperor, when her flight had been discovered; and all the courtiers blamed her, and said she was a very ungrateful creature.
"But we have the best bird after all," said one, and then they would have the bird sing again, although it was the thirty-fourth time they had listened to the same piece, and even then they had not learnt it, for it was rather difficult.
But the music-master praised the bird in the highest degree, and even asserted that it was better than a real nightingale, not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds, but also in its musical power.
"For you must perceive, my chief lord and emperor, that with a real nightingale we can never tell what is going to be sung, but with this bird everything is settled.
It can be opened and explained, so that people may understand how the waltzes are formed, and why one note follows upon another."
"This is exactly what we think," they all replied, and then the music-master received permission to exhibit the bird to the people on the following Sunday, and the emperor commanded that they should be present to hear it sing.
When they heard it they were like people intoxicated; however it must have been with drinking tea, which is quite a Chinese custom.
They all said "Oh!" and held up their forefingers and nodded, but a poor fisherman, who had heard the real nightingale, said, "it sounds prettily enough, and the melodies are all alike; yet there seems something wanting, I cannot exactly tell what."
And after this the real nightingale was banished from the empire, and the artificial bird placed on a silk cushion close to the emperor's bed.
The presents of gold and precious stones which had been received with it were round the bird, and it was now advanced to the title of "Little Imperial Toilet Singer," and to the rank of No. 1 on the left hand; for the emperor considered the left side, on which the heart lies, as the most noble, and the heart of an emperor is in the same place as that of other people.
The music-master wrote a work, in twenty-five volumes, about the artificial bird, which was very learned and very long, and full of the most difficult Chinese words; yet all the people said they had read it, and understood it, for fear of being thought stupid and having their bodies trampled upon.
So a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other Chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song; and for that same reason it pleased them better.
They could sing with the bird, which they often did.
The street-boys sang, "Zi-zi-zi, cluck, cluck, cluck," and the emperor himself could sing it also.
It was really most amusing.
One evening, when the artificial bird was singing its best, and the emperor lay in bed listening to it, something inside the bird sounded "whizz."
Then a spring cracked.
"Whir-r-r-r" went all the wheels, running round, and then the music stopped.
The emperor immediately sprang out of bed, and called for his physician; but what could he do?
Then they sent for a watchmaker; and, after a great deal of talking and examination, the bird was put into something like order; but he said that it must be used very carefully, as the barrels were worn, and it would be impossible to put in new ones without injuring the music.
Now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it.
Then the music-master made a little speech, full of hard words, and declared that the bird was as good as ever; and, of course no one contradicted him.
Five years passed, and then a real grief came upon the land.
The Chinese really were fond of their emperor, and he now lay so ill that he was not expected to live.
Already a new emperor had been chosen and the people who stood in the street asked the lord-in-waiting how the old emperor was; but he only said, "Pooh!" and shook his head.
Cold and pale lay the emperor in his royal bed; the whole court thought he was dead, and every one ran away to pay homage to his successor.
The chamberlains went out to have a talk on the matter, and the ladies'-maids invited company to take coffee.
Cloth had been laid down on the halls and passages, so that not a footstep should be heard, and all was silent and still.
But the emperor was not yet dead, although he lay white and stiff on his gorgeous bed, with the long velvet curtains and heavy gold tassels.
A window stood open, and the moon shone in upon the emperor and the artificial bird.
The poor emperor, finding he could scarcely breathe with a strange weight on his chest, opened his eyes, and saw Death sitting there.
He had put on the emperor's golden crown, and held in one hand his sword of state, and in the other his beautiful banner.
All around the bed and peeping through the long velvet curtains, were a number of strange heads, some very ugly, and others lovely and gentle-looking.
These were the emperor's good and bad deeds, which stared him in the face now Death sat at his heart.
"Do you remember this?"
"Do you recollect that?" they asked one after another, thus bringing to his remembrance circumstances that made the perspiration stand on his brow.
"I know nothing about it," said the emperor.
"Music! music!" he cried; "the large Chinese drum! that I may not hear what they say."
But they still went on, and Death nodded like a Chinaman to all they said.
"Music! music!" shouted the emperor.
"You little precious golden bird, sing, pray sing!
I have given you gold and costly presents; I have even hung my golden slipper round your neck.
Sing! sing!"
But the bird remained silent.
There was no one to wind it up, and therefore it could not sing a note.
Death continued to stare at the emperor with his cold, hollow eyes, and the room was fearfully still.
Suddenly there came through the open window the sound of sweet music.
Outside, on the bough of a tree, sat the living nightingale.
She had heard of the emperor's illness, and was therefore come to sing to him of hope and trust.
And as she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler; the blood in the emperor's veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to his weak limbs; and even Death himself listened, and said, "Go on, little nightingale, go on."
"Then will you give me the beautiful golden sword and that rich banner? and will you give me the emperor's crown?" said the bird.
So Death gave up each of these treasures for a song; and the nightingale continued her singing.
She sung of the quiet churchyard, where the white roses grow, where the elder-tree wafts its perfume on the breeze, and the fresh, sweet grass is moistened by the mourners' tears.
Then Death longed to go and see his garden, and floated out through the window in the form of a cold, white mist.
"Thanks, thanks, you heavenly little bird.
I know you well.
I banished you from my kingdom once, and yet you have charmed away the evil faces from my bed, and banished Death from my heart, with your sweet song.
How can I reward you?"
"You have already rewarded me," said the nightingale.
"I shall never forget that I drew tears from your eyes the first time I sang to you.
These are the jewels that rejoice a singer's heart.
But now sleep, and grow strong and well again.
I will sing to you again."
And as she sung, the emperor fell into a sweet sleep; and how mild and refreshing that slumber was!
When he awoke, strengthened and restored, the sun shone brightly through the window; but not one of his servants had returned- they all believed he was dead; only the nightingale still sat beside him, and sang.
"You must always remain with me," said the emperor.
"You shall sing only when it pleases you; and I will break the artificial bird into a thousand pieces."
"No; do not do that," replied the nightingale; "the bird did very well as long as it could.
Keep it here still.
I cannot live in the palace, and build my nest; but let me come when I like.
I will sit on a bough outside your window, in the evening, and sing to you, so that you may be happy, and have thoughts full of joy.
I will sing to you of those who are happy, and those who suffer; of the good and the evil, who are hidden around you.
The little singing bird flies far from you and your court to the home of the fisherman and the peasant's cot.
I love your heart better than your crown; and yet something holy lingers round that also.
I will come, I will sing to you; but you must promise me one thing."
"Everything," said the emperor, who, having dressed himself in his imperial robes, stood with the hand that held the heavy golden sword pressed to his heart.
"I only ask one thing," she replied; "let no one know that you have a little bird who tells you everything.
It will be best to conceal it."
So saying, the nightingale flew away.
The servants now came in to look after the dead emperor; when, lo! there he stood, and, to their astonishment, said, "Good morning."
THAT was a terrible affair!" said a hen, and in a quarter of the town, too, where it had not taken place.
"That was a terrible affair in a hen-roost.
I cannot sleep alone to-night.
It is a good thing that many of us sit on the roost together."
And then she told a story that made the feathers on the other hens bristle up, and the cock's comb fall.
There was no doubt about it.
But we will begin at the beginning, and that is to be found in a hen-roost in another part of the town.
The sun was setting, and the fowls were flying on to their roost; one hen, with white feathers and short legs, used to lay her eggs according to the regulations, and was, as a hen, respectable in every way.
As she was flying upon the roost, she plucked herself with her beak, and a little feather came out.
"There it goes," she said; "the more I pluck, the more beautiful do I get."
She said this merrily, for she was the best of the hens, and, moreover, as had been said, very respectable.
With that she went to sleep.
It was dark all around, and hen sat close to hen, but the one who sat nearest to her merry neighbour did not sleep.
She had heard and yet not heard, as we are often obliged to do in this world, in order to live at peace; but she could not keep it from her neighbour on the other side any longer.
"Did you hear what was said?
I mention no names, but there is a hen here who intends to pluck herself in order to look well.
If I were a cock, I should despise her."
Just over the fowls sat the owl, with father owl and the little owls.
The family has sharp ears, and they all heard every word that their neighbour had said.
They rolled their eyes, and mother owl, beating her wings, said: "Don't listen to her!
But I suppose you heard what was said?
I heard it with my own ears, and one has to hear a great deal before they fall off.
There is one among the fowls who has so far forgotten what is becoming to a hen that she plucks out all her feathers and lets the cock see it."
"Prenez garde aux enfants!" said father owl; "children should not hear such things."
"But I must tell our neighbour owl about it; she is such an estimable owl to talk to."
And with that she flew away.
"Too-whoo!
Too-whoo!" they both hooted into the neighbour's dove-cot to the doves inside.
"Have you heard?
Have you heard?
Too-whoo!
There is a hen who has plucked out all her feathers for the sake of the cock; she will freeze to death, if she is not frozen already.
Too-whoo!"
"Where? where?" cooed the doves.
"In the neighbour's yard.
I have as good as seen it myself.
It is almost unbecoming to tell the story, but there is no doubt about it."
"Believe every word of what we tell you," said the doves, and cooed down into their poultry-yard.
"There is a hen- nay, some say that there are two- who have plucked out all their feathers, in order not to look like the others, and to attract the attention of the cock.
It is a dangerous game, for one can easily catch cold and die from fever, and both of these are dead already."
"Wake up! wake up!" crowed the cock, and flew upon his board.
Sleep was still in his eyes, but yet he crowed out: "Three hens have died of their unfortunate love for a cock.
They had plucked out all their feathers.
It is a horrible story: I will not keep it to myself, but let it go farther."
"Let it go farther," shrieked the bats, and the hens clucked and the cocks crowed, "Let it go farther!
Let it go farther!"
In this way the story travelled from poultry-yard to poultry-yard, and at last came back to the place from which it had really started.
"Five hens," it now ran, "have plucked out all their feathers to show which of them had grown leanest for love of the cock, and then they all pecked at each other till the blood ran down and they fell down dead, to the derision and shame of their family, and to the great loss of their owner."
The hen who had lost the loose little feather naturally did not recognise her own story, and being a respectable hen, said: "I despise those fowls; but there are more of that kind.
Such things ought not to be concealed, and I will do my best to get the story into the papers, so that it becomes known throughout the land; the hens have richly deserved it, and their family too."
It got into the papers, it was printed; and there is no doubt about it, one little feather may easily grow into five hens.
FATHER, and mother, and brothers, and sisters, were gone to the play; only little Anna and her grandpapa were left at home.
"We'll have a play too," he said, "and it may begin immediately."
"But we have no theatre," cried little Anna, "and we have no one to act for us; my old doll cannot, for she is a fright, and my new one cannot, for she must not rumple her new clothes."
"One can always get actors if one makes use of what one has," observed grandpapa.
"Now we'll go into the theatre.
Here we will put up a book, there another, and there a third, in a sloping row.
Now three on the other side; so, now we have the side scenes.
The old box that lies yonder may be the back stairs; and we'll lay the flooring on top of it.
The stage represents a room, as every one may see.
Now we want the actors.
Let us see what we can find in the plaything-box.
First the personages, and then we will get the play ready.
One after the other; that will be capital!
Here's a pipe-head, and yonder an odd glove; they will do very well for father and daughter."
"But those are only two characters," said little Anna.
"Here's my brother's old waistcoat- could not that play in our piece, too?"
"It's big enough, certainly," replied grandpapa.
"It shall be the lover.
There's nothing in the pockets, and that's very interesting, for that's half of an unfortunate attachment.
And here we have the nut-cracker's boots, with spurs to them.
Row, dow, dow! how they can stamp and strut!
They shall represent the unwelcome wooer, whom the lady does not like.
What kind of a play will you have now?
Shall it be a tragedy, or a domestic drama?"
"A domestic drama, please," said little Anna, "for the others are so fond of that.
Do you know one?"
"I know a hundred," said grandpapa.
"Those that are most in favor are from the French, but they are not good for little girls.
In the meantime, we may take one of the prettiest, for inside they're all very much alike.
Now I shake the pen!
Cock-a-lorum!
So now, here's the play, brin-bran-span new!
Now listen to the play-bill."
And grandpapa took a newspaper, and read as if he were reading from it:
THE PIPE-HEAD AND THE GOOD HEAD A Family Drama in One Act CHARACTERS
MR. PIPE-HEAD, a father.
MR. WAISTCOAT, a lover.
MISS GLOVE, a daughter.
MR. DE BOOTS, a suitor.
"And now we're going to begin.
The curtain rises.
We have no curtain, so it has risen already.
All the characters are there, and so we have them at hand.
Now I speak as Papa Pipe-head!
He's angry to-day.
One can see that he's a colored meerschaum.
"'Snik, snak, snurre, bassellurre!
I'm master of this house!
I'm the father of my daughter!
Will you hear what I have to say?
Mr. de Boots is a person in whom one may see one's face; his upper part is of morocco, and he has spurs into the bargain.
Snikke, snakke, snak!
He shall have my daughter!"
"Now listen to what the Waistcoat says, little Anna," said grandpapa.
"Now the Waistcoat's speaking.
The Waistcoat has a laydown collar, and is very modest; but he knows his own value, and has quite a right to say what he says: "'I haven't a spot on me!
Goodness of material ought to be appreciated.
I am of real silk, and have strings to me.'
"'- On the wedding day, but no longer; you don't keep your color in the wash.'
This is Mr. Pipe-head who is speaking.
'Mr. de Boots is water-tight, of strong leather, and yet very delicate; he can creak, and clank with his spurs, and has an Italian physiognomy-'" "But they ought to speak in verses," said Anna, "for I've heard that's the most charming way of all."
"They can do that too," replied grandpapa; "and if the public demands it, they will talk in that way.
Just look at little Miss Glove, how she's pointing her fingers!
"'Could I but have my love, Who then so happy as Glove!
Ah!
If I from him must part, I'm sure 'twill break my heart!' 'Bah!'
The last word was spoken by Mr. Pipe-head; and now it's Mr. Waistcoat's turn:
"'O Glove, my own dear, Though it cost thee a tear, Thou must be mine, For Holger Danske has sworn it!'
"Mr. de Boots, hearing this, kicks up, jingles his spurs, and knocks down three of the side-scenes."
"That's exceedingly charming!" cried little Anna.
"Silence! silence!" said grandpapa.
"Silent approbation will show that you are the educated public in the stalls.
Now Miss Glove sings her great song with startling effects:
"'I can't see, heigho!
And therefore I'll crow!
Kikkeriki, in the lofty hall!'
"Now comes the exciting part, little Anna.
This is the most important in all the play.
Mr. Waistcoat undoes himself, and addresses his speech to you, that you may applaud; but leave it alone,- that's considered more genteel.
"'I am driven to extremities!
Take care of yourself!
Now comes the plot!
You are the Pipe-head, and I am the good head- snap! there you go!"
"Do you notice this, little Anna?" asked grandpapa.
"That's a most charming comedy.
Mr. Waistcoat seized the old Pipe-head and put him in his pocket; there he lies, and the Waistcoat says: "'You are in my pocket; you can't come out till you promise to unite me to your daughter Glove on the left.
I hold out my right hand.'"
"That's awfully pretty," said little Anna.
"And now the old Pipe-head replies:
"'Though I'm all ear, Very stupid I appear: Where's my humor?
Gone, I fear, And I feel my hollow stick's not here, Ah! never, my dear, Did I feel so queer.
Oh! pray let me out, And like a lamb led to slaughter I'll betroth you, no doubt, To my daughter.'"
"Is the play over already?" asked little Anna.
"By no means," replied grandpapa.
"It's only all over with Mr. de Boots.
Now the lovers kneel down, and one of them sings:
"'Father!'
and the other,
'Come, do as you ought to do,- Bless your son and daughter.'
And they receive his blessing, and celebrate their wedding, and all the pieces of furniture sing in chorus,
"'Klink! clanks!
A thousand thanks; And now the play is over!'
"And now we'll applaud," said grandpapa.
"We'll call them all out, and the pieces of furniture too, for they are of mahogany."
"And is not our play just as good as those which the others have in the real theatre?"
"Our play is much better," said grandpapa.
"It is shorter, the performers are natural, and it has passed away the interval before tea-time."
THERE is a street in Copenhagen with a very strange name.
It is called "Hysken" street.
Where the name came from, and what it means is very uncertain.
It is said to be German, but that is unjust to the Germans, for it would then be called "Hauschen," not "Hysken."
"Hauschen," means a little house; and for many years it consisted only of a few small houses, which were scarcely larger than the wooden booths we see in the market-places at fair time.
They were perhaps a little higher, and had windows; but the panes consisted of horn or bladder-skins, for glass was then too dear to have glazed windows in every house.
This was a long time ago, so long indeed that our grandfathers, and even great-grandfathers, would speak of those days as "olden times;" indeed, many centuries have passed since then.
The rich merchants in Bremen and Lubeck, who carried on trade in Copenhagen, did not reside in the town themselves, but sent their clerks, who dwelt in the wooden booths in the Hauschen street, and sold beer and spices.
The German beer was very good, and there were many sorts- from Bremen, Prussia, and Brunswick- and quantities of all sorts of spices, saffron, aniseed, ginger, and especially pepper; indeed, pepper was almost the chief article sold here; so it happened at last that the German clerks in Denmark got their nickname of "pepper gentry."
It had been made a condition with these clerks that they should not marry; so that those who lived to be old had to take care of themselves, to attend to their own comforts, and even to light their own fires, when they had any to light.
Many of them were very aged; lonely old boys, with strange thoughts and eccentric habits.
From this, all unmarried men, who have attained a certain age, are called, in Denmark, "pepper gentry;" and this must be remembered by all those who wish to understand the story.
These "pepper gentlemen," or, as they are called in England, "old bachelors," are often made a butt of ridicule; they are told to put on their nightcaps, draw them over their eyes, and go to sleep.
The boys in Denmark make a song of it, thus:-
"Poor old bachelor, cut your wood, Such a nightcap was never seen; Who would think it was ever clean?
Go to sleep, it will do you good."
So they sing about the "pepper gentleman;" so do they make sport of the poor old bachelor and his nightcap, and all because they really know nothing of either.
It is a cap that no one need wish for, or laugh at.
And why not?
Well, we shall hear in the story.
In olden times, Hauschen Street was not paved, and passengers would stumble out of one hole into another, as they generally do in unfrequented highways; and the street was so narrow, and the booths leaning against each other were so close together, that in the summer time a sail would be stretched across the street from one booth to another opposite.
At these times the odor of the pepper, saffron, and ginger became more powerful than ever.
Behind the counter, as a rule, there were no young men.
The clerks were almost all old boys; but they did not dress as we are accustomed to see old men represented, wearing wigs, nightcaps, and knee-breeches, and with coat and waistcoat buttoned up to the chin.
We have seen the portraits of our great-grandfathers dressed in this way; but the "pepper gentlemen" had no money to spare to have their portraits taken, though one of them would have made a very interesting picture for us now, if taken as he appeared standing behind his counter, or going to church, or on holidays.
On these occasions, they wore high-crowned, broad-brimmed hats, and sometimes a younger clerk would stick a feather in his.
The woollen shirt was concealed by a broad, linen collar; the close jacket was buttoned up to the chin, and the cloak hung loosely over it; the trousers were tucked into the broad, tipped shoes, for the clerks wore no stockings.
They generally stuck a table-knife and spoon in their girdles, as well as a larger knife, as a protection to themselves; and such a weapon was often very necessary.
After this fashion was Anthony dressed on holidays and festivals, excepting that, instead of a high-crowned hat, he wore a kind of bonnet, and under it a knitted cap, a regular nightcap, to which he was so accustomed that it was always on his head; he had two, nightcaps I mean, not heads.
Anthony was one of the oldest of the clerks, and just the subject for a painter.
He was as thin as a lath, wrinkled round the mouth and eyes, had long, bony fingers, bushy, gray eyebrows, and over his left eye hung a thick tuft of hair, which did not look handsome, but made his appearance very remarkable.
People knew that he came from Bremen; it was not exactly his home, although his master resided there.
His ancestors were from Thuringia, and had lived in the town of Eisenach, close by Wartburg.
Old Anthony seldom spoke of this place, but he thought of it all the more.
The old clerks of Hauschen Street very seldom met together; each one remained in his own booth, which was closed early enough in the evening, and then it looked dark and dismal out in the street.
Only a faint glimmer of light struggled through the horn panes in the little window on the roof, while within sat the old clerk, generally on his bed, singing his evening hymn in a low voice; or he would be moving about in his booth till late in the night, busily employed in many things.
It certainly was not a very lively existence.
To be a stranger in a strange land is a bitter lot; no one notices you unless you happen to stand in their way.
Often, when it was dark night outside, with rain or snow falling, the place looked quite deserted and gloomy.
There were no lamps in the street, excepting a very small one, which hung at one end of the street, before a picture of the Virgin, which had been painted on the wall.
The dashing of the water against the bulwarks of a neighboring castle could plainly be heard.
Such evenings are long and dreary, unless people can find something to do; and so Anthony found it.
There were not always things to be packed or unpacked, nor paper bags to be made, nor the scales to be polished.
So Anthony invented employment; he mended his clothes and patched his boots, and when he at last went to bed,- his nightcap, which he had worn from habit, still remained on his head; he had only to pull it down a little farther over his forehead.
Very soon, however, it would be pushed up again to see if the light was properly put out; he would touch it, press the wick together, and at last pull his nightcap over his eyes and lie down again on the other side.
But often there would arise in his mind a doubt as to whether every coal had been quite put out in the little fire-pan in the shop below.
If even a tiny spark had remained it might set fire to something, and cause great damage.
Then he would rise from his bed, creep down the ladder- for it could scarcely be called a flight of stairs- and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be seen; so he had just to go back again to bed.
But often, when he had got half way back, he would fancy the iron shutters of the door were not properly fastened, and his thin legs would carry him down again.
And when at last he crept into bed, he would be so cold that his teeth chattered in his head.
He would draw the coverlet closer round him, pull his nightcap over his eyes, and try to turn his thoughts from trade, and from the labors of the day, to olden times.
But this was scarcely an agreeable entertainment; for thoughts of olden memories raise the curtains from the past, and sometimes pierce the heart with painful recollections till the agony brings tears to the waking eyes.
And so it was with Anthony; often the scalding tears, like pearly drops, would fall from his eyes to the coverlet and roll on the floor with a sound as if one of his heartstrings had broken.
Sometimes, with a lurid flame, memory would light up a picture of life which had never faded from his heart.
If he dried his eyes with his nightcap, then the tear and the picture would be crushed; but the source of the tears remained and welled up again in his heart.
The pictures did not follow one another in order, as the circumstances they represented had occurred; very often the most painful would come together, and when those came which were most full of joy, they had always the deepest shadow thrown upon them.
The beech woods of Denmark are acknowledged by every one to be very beautiful, but more beautiful still in the eyes of old Anthony were the beech woods in the neighborhood of Wartburg.
More grand and venerable to him seemed the old oaks around the proud baronial castle, where the creeping plants hung over the stony summits of the rocks; sweeter was the perfume there of the apple-blossom than in all the land of Denmark.
How vividly were represented to him, in a glittering tear that rolled down his cheek, two children at play- a boy and a girl.
The boy had rosy cheeks, golden ringlets, and clear, blue eyes; he was the son of Anthony, a rich merchant; it was himself.
The little girl had brown eyes and black hair, and was clever and courageous; she was the mayor's daughter, Molly.
The children were playing with an apple; they shook the apple, and heard the pips rattling in it.
Then they cut it in two, and each of them took half.
They also divided the pips and ate all but one, which the little girl proposed should be placed in the ground.
"You will see what will come out," she said; "something you don't expect.
A whole apple-tree will come out, but not directly."
Then they got a flower-pot, filled it with earth, and were soon both very busy and eager about it.
The boy made a hole in the earth with his finger, and the little girl placed the pip in the hole, and then they both covered it over with earth.
"Now you must not take it out to-morrow to see if it has taken root," said Molly; "no one ever should do that.
I did so with my flowers, but only twice; I wanted to see if they were growing.
I didn't know any better then, and the flowers all died."
Little Anthony kept the flower-pot, and every morning during the whole winter he looked at it, but there was nothing to be seen but black earth.
At last, however, the spring came, and the sun shone warm again, and then two little green leaves sprouted forth in the pot.
"They are Molly and me," said the boy.
"How wonderful they are, and so beautiful!"
Very soon a third leaf made its appearance.
"Who does that stand for?" thought he, and then came another and another.
Day after day, and week after week, till the plant became quite a tree.
And all this about the two children was mirrored to old Anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped away and disappear, but might come again from its source in the heart of the old man.
In the neighborhood of Eisenach stretches a ridge of stony mountains, one of which has a rounded outline, and shows itself above the rest without tree, bush, or grass on its barren summits.
It is called the "Venus Mountain," and the story goes that the "Lady Venus," one of the heathen goddesses, keeps house there.
She is also called "Lady Halle," as every child round Eisenach well knows.
She it was who enticed the noble knight, Tannhauser, the minstrel, from the circle of singers at Wartburg into her mountain.
Little Molly and Anthony often stood by this mountain, and one day Molly said, "Do you dare to knock and say, 'Lady Halle, Lady Halle, open the door: Tannhauser is here!'"
But Anthony did not dare.
Molly, however, did, though she only said the words, "Lady Halle, Lady Halle," loudly and distinctly; the rest she muttered so much under her breath that Anthony felt certain she had really said nothing; and yet she looked quite bold and saucy, just as she did sometimes when she was in the garden with a number of other little girls; they would all stand round him together, and want to kiss him, because he did not like to be kissed, and pushed them away.
Then Molly was the only one who dared to resist him.
"I may kiss him," she would say proudly, as she threw her arms round his neck; she was vain of her power over Anthony, for he would submit quietly and think nothing of it.
Molly was very charming, but rather bold; and how she did tease!
They said Lady Halle was beautiful, but her beauty was that of a tempting fiend.
Saint Elizabeth, the tutelar saint of the land, the pious princess of Thuringia, whose good deeds have been immortalized in so many places through stories and legends, had greater beauty and more real grace.
Her picture hung in the chapel, surrounded by silver lamps; but it did not in the least resemble Molly.
The apple-tree, which the two children had planted, grew year after year, till it became so large that it had to be transplanted into the garden, where the dew fell and the sun shone warmly.
And there it increased in strength so much as to be able to withstand the cold of winter; and after passing through the severe weather, it seemed to put forth its blossoms in spring for very joy that the cold season had gone.
In autumn it produced two apples, one for Molly and one for Anthony; it could not well do less.
The tree after this grew very rapidly, and Molly grew with the tree.
She was as fresh as an apple-blossom, but Anthony was not to behold this flower for long.
All things change; Molly's father left his old home, and Molly went with him far away.
In our time, it would be only a journey of a few hours, but then it took more than a day and a night to travel so far eastward from Eisenbach to a town still called Weimar, on the borders of Thuringia.
And Molly and Anthony both wept, but these tears all flowed together into one tear which had the rosy shimmer of joy.
Molly had told him that she loved him- loved him more than all the splendors of Weimar.
One, two, three years went by, and during the whole time he received only two letters.
One came by the carrier, and the other a traveller brought.
The way was very long and difficult, with many turnings and windings through towns and villages.
How often had Anthony and Molly heard the story of Tristan and Isolda, and Anthony had thought the story applied to him, although Tristan means born in sorrow, which Anthony certainly was not; nor was it likely he would ever say of Molly as Tristan said of Isolda, "She has forgotten me."
But in truth, Isolda had not forgotten him, her faithful friend; and when both were laid in their graves, one, on each side of the church, the linden-trees that grew by each grave spread over the roof, and, bending towards each other, mingled their blossoms together.
Anthony thought it a very beautiful but mournful story; yet he never feared anything so sad would happen to him and Molly, as he passed the spot, whistling the air of a song, composed by the minstrel Walter, called the "Willow bird," beginning-
"Under the linden-trees, Out on the heath."
One stanza pleased him exceedingly-
"Through the forest, and in the vale, Sweetly warbles the nightingale.
This song was often in his mouth, and he sung or whistled it on a moonlight night, when he rode on horseback along the deep, hollow way, on his road to Weimar, to visit Molly.
He wished to arrive unexpectedly, and so indeed he did.
He was received with a hearty welcome, and introduced to plenty of grand and pleasant company, where overflowing winecups were passed about.
A pretty room and a good bed were provided for him, and yet his reception was not what he had expected and dreamed it would be.
He could not comprehend his own feelings nor the feelings of others; but it is easily understood how a person can be admitted into a house or a family without becoming one of them.
We converse in company with those we meet, as we converse with our fellow-travellers in a stage-coach, on a journey; we know nothing of them, and perhaps all the while we are incommoding one another, and each is wishing himself or his neighbor away.
Something of this kind Anthony felt when Molly talked to him of old times.
"I am a straightforward girl," she said, "and I will tell you myself how it is.
There have been great changes since we were children together; everything is different, both inwardly and outwardly.
We cannot control our wills, nor the feelings of our hearts, by the force of custom.
Anthony, I would not, for the world, make an enemy of you when I am far away.
Believe me, I entertain for you the kindest wishes in my heart; but to feel for you what I now know can be felt for another man, can never be.
You must try and reconcile yourself to this.
Farewell, Anthony."
Anthony also said, "Farewell."
Not a tear came into his eye; he felt he was no longer Molly's friend.
Hot iron and cold iron alike take the skin from our lips, and we feel the same sensation if we kiss either; and Anthony's kiss was now the kiss of hatred, as it had once been the kiss of love.
Within four-and-twenty hours Anthony was back again to Eisenach, though the horse that he rode was entirely ruined.
"What matters it?" said he; "I am ruined also.
I will destroy everything that can remind me of her, or of Lady Halle, or Lady Venus, the heathen woman.
I will break down the apple-tree, and tear it up by the roots; never more shall it blossom or bear fruit."
The apple-tree was not broken down; for Anthony himself was struck with a fever, which caused him to break down, and confined him to his bed.
But something occurred to raise him up again.
What was it?
A medicine was offered to him, which he was obliged to take: a bitter remedy, at which the sick body and the oppressed spirit alike shuddered.
Anthony's father lost all his property, and, from being known as one of the richest merchants, he became very poor.
Dark days, heavy trials, with poverty at the door, came rolling into the house upon them like the waves of the sea.
Sorrow and suffering deprived Anthony's father of his strength, so that he had something else to think of besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against Molly.
He had to take his father's place, to give orders, to act with energy, to help, and, at last, to go out into the world and earn his bread.
Anthony went to Bremen, and there he learnt what poverty and hard living really were.
These things often harden the character, but sometimes soften the heart, even too much.
How different the world, and the people in it, appeared to Anthony now, to what he had thought in his childhood!
What to him were the minstrel's songs?
An echo of the past, sounds long vanished.
At times he would think in this way; yet again and again the songs would sound in his soul, and his heart become gentle and pious.
"God's will is the best," he would then say.
"It was well that I was not allowed to keep my power over Molly's heart, and that she did not remain true to me.
How I should have felt it now, when fortune has deserted me!
She left me before she knew of the change in my circumstances, or had a thought of what was before me.
That is a merciful providence for me.
All has happened for the best.
She could not help it, and yet I have been so bitter, and in such enmity against her."
Years passed by: Anthony's father died, and strangers lived in the old house.
He had seen it once again since then.
His rich master sent him journeys on business, and on one occasion his way led him to his native town of Eisenach.
The old Wartburg castle stood unchanged on the rock where the monk and the nun were hewn out of the stone.
The great oaks formed an outline to the scene which he so well remembered in his childhood.
The Venus mountain stood out gray and bare, overshadowing the valley beneath.
He would have been glad to call out "Lady Halle, Lady Halle, unlock the mountain.
I would fain remain here always in my native soil."
That was a sinful thought, and he offered a prayer to drive it away.
Then a little bird in the thicket sang out clearly, and old Anthony thought of the minstrel's song.
How much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town!
The old house was still standing as in olden times, but the garden had been greatly altered; a pathway led through a portion of the ground, and outside the garden, and beyond the path, stood the old apple-tree, which he had not broken down, although he talked of doing so in his trouble.
The sun still threw its rays upon the tree, and the refreshing dew fell upon it as of old; and it was so overloaded with fruit that the branches bent towards the earth with the weight.
"That flourishes still," said he, as he gazed.
One of the branches of the tree had, however, been broken: mischievous hands must have done this in passing, for the tree now stood in a public thoroughfare.
"The blossoms are often plucked," said Anthony; "the fruit is stolen and the branches broken without a thankful thought of their profusion and beauty.
It might be said of a tree, as it has been said of some men- it was not predicted at his cradle that he should come to this.
How brightly began the history of this tree, and what is it now?
Forsaken and forgotten, in a garden by a hedge in a field, and close to a public road.
There it stands, unsheltered, plundered, and broken.
It certainly has not yet withered; but in the course of years the number of blossoms from time to time will grow less, and at last it was cease altogether to bear fruit; and then its history will be over."
Such were Anthony's thoughts as he stood under the tree, and during many a long night as he lay in his lonely chamber in the wooden house in Hauschen Street, Copenhagen, in the foreign land to which the rich merchant of Bremen, his employer, had sent him on condition that he should never marry.
"Marry! ha, ha!" and he laughed bitterly to himself at the thought.
Winter one year set in early, and it was freezing hard.
Without, a snowstorm made every one remain at home who could do so.
Thus it happened that Anthony's neighbors, who lived opposite to him, did not notice that his house remained unopened for two days, and that he had not showed himself during that time, for who would go out in such weather unless he were obliged to do so.
They were gray, gloomy days, and in the house whose windows were not glass, twilight and dark nights reigned in turns.
During these two days old Anthony had not left his bed, he had not the strength to do so.
The bitter weather had for some time affected his limbs.
There lay the old bachelor, forsaken by all, and unable to help himself.
He could scarcely reach the water jug that he had placed by his bed, and the last drop was gone.
It was not fever, nor sickness, but old age, that had laid him low.
In the little corner, where his bed lay, he was over-shadowed as it were by perpetual night.
A little spider, which he could however not see, busily and cheerfully spun its web above him, so that there should be a kind of little banner waving over the old man, when his eyes closed.
The time passed slowly and painfully.
He had no tears to shed, and he felt no pain; no thought of Molly came into his mind.
He felt as if the world was now nothing to him, as if he were lying beyond it, with no one to think of him.
Now and then he felt slight sensations of hunger and thirst; but no one came to him, no one tended him.
He thought of all those who had once suffered from starvation, of Saint Elizabeth, who once wandered on the earth, the saint of his home and his childhood, the noble Duchess of Thuringia, that highly esteemed lady who visited the poorest villages, bringing hope and relief to the sick inmates.
The recollection of her pious deeds was as light to the soul of poor Anthony.
He thought of her as she went about speaking words of comfort, binding up the wounds of the afflicted and feeding the hungry, although often blamed for it by her stern husband.
He remembered a story told of her, that on one occasion, when she was carrying a basket full of wine and provisions, her husband, who had watched her footsteps, stepped forward and asked her angrily what she carried in her basket, whereupon, with fear and trembling, she answered, "Roses, which I have plucked from the garden."
Then he tore away the cloth which covered the basket, and what could equal the surprise of the pious woman, to find that by a miracle, everything in her basket- the wine, the bread- had all been changed into roses.
In this way the memory of the kind lady dwelt in the calm mind of Anthony.
She was as a living reality in his little dwelling in the Danish land.
He uncovered his face that he might look into her gentle eyes, while everything around him changed from its look of poverty and want, to a bright rose tint.
The fragrance of roses spread through the room, mingled with the sweet smell of apples.
He saw the branches of an apple-tree spreading above him.
It was the tree which he and Molly had planted together.
The fragrant leaves of the tree fell upon him and cooled his burning brow; upon his parched lips they seemed like refreshing bread and wine; and as they rested on his breast, a peaceful calm stole over him, and he felt inclined to sleep.
"I shall sleep now," he whispered to himself.
"Sleep will do me good.
In the morning I shall be upon my feet again, strong and well.
Glorious! wonderful!
That apple-tree, planted in love, now appears before me in heavenly beauty."
And he slept.
The following day, the third day during which his house had been closed, the snow-storm ceased.
Then his opposite neighbor stepped over to the house in which old Anthony lived, for he had not yet showed himself.
There he lay stretched on his bed, dead, with his old nightcap tightly clasped in his two hands.
The nightcap, however, was not placed on his head in his coffin; he had a clean white one on then.
Where now were the tears he had shed?
What had become of those wonderful pearls?
They were in the nightcap still.
Such tears as these cannot be washed out, even when the nightcap is forgotten.
The old thoughts and dreams of a bachelor's nightcap still remain.
Never wish for such a nightcap.
It would make your forehead hot, cause your pulse to beat with agitation, and conjure up dreams which would appear realities.
The first who wore old Anthony's cap felt the truth of this, though it was half a century afterwards.
That man was the mayor himself, who had already made a comfortable home for his wife and eleven children, by his industry.
The moment he put the cap on he dreamed of unfortunate love, of bankruptcy, and of dark days.
"Hallo! how the nightcap burns!" he exclaimed, as he tore it from his bead.
Then a pearl rolled out, and then another, and another, and they glittered and sounded as they fell.
"What can this be?
Is it paralysis, or something dazzling my eyes?"
They were the tears which old Anthony had shed half a century before.
To every one who afterwards put this cap on his head, came visions and dreams which agitated him not a little.
His own history was changed into that of Anthony till it became quite a story, and many stories might be made by others, so we will leave them to relate their own.
We have told the first; and our last word is, don't wish for a "bachelor's nightcap."
IN the country of Wurtemburg, in Germany, where the acacias grow by the public road, where the apple-trees and the pear-trees in autumn bend to the earth with the weight of the precious fruit, lies the little town of Marbach.
As is often the case with many of these towns, it is charmingly situated on the banks of the river Neckar, which rushes rapidly by, passing villages, old knights' castles, and green vineyards, till its waters mingle with those of the stately Rhine.
It was late in the autumn; the vine-leaves still hung upon the branches of the vines, but they were already tinted with red and gold; heavy showers fell on the surrounding country, and the cold autumn wind blew sharp and strong.
It was not at all pleasant weather for the poor.
The days grew shorter and more gloomy, and, dark as it was out of doors in the open air, it was still darker within the small, old-fashioned houses of the village.
The gable end of one of these houses faced the street, and with its small, narrow windows, presented a very mean appearance.
The family who dwelt in it were also very poor and humble, but they treasured the fear of God in their innermost hearts.
And now He was about to send them a child.
It was the hour of the mother's sorrow, when there pealed forth from the church tower the sound of festive bells.
In that solemn hour the sweet and joyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwelling with thankfulness and trust; and when, amidst these joyous sounds, a little son was born to them, the words of prayer and praise arose from their overflowing hearts, and their happiness seemed to ring out over town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells' chime.
The little one, with its bright eyes and golden hair, had been welcomed joyously on that dark November day.
Its parents kissed it lovingly, and the father wrote these words in the Bible, "On the tenth of November, 1759, God sent us a son."
And a short time after, when the child had been baptized, the names he had received were added, "John Christopher Frederick."
And what became of the little lad?- the poor boy of the humble town of Marbach?
Ah, indeed, there was no one who thought or supposed, not even the old church bell which had been the first to sound and chime for him, that he would be the first to sing the beautiful song of "The Bell."
The boy grew apace, and the world advanced with him.
While he was yet a child, his parents removed from Marbach, and went to reside in another town; but their dearest friends remained behind at Marbach, and therefore sometimes the mother and her son would start on a fine day to pay a visit to the little town.
The boy was at this time about six years old, and already knew a great many stories out of the Bible, and several religious psalms.
While seated in the evening on his little cane-chair, he had often heard his father read from Gellert's fables, and sometimes from Klopstock's grand poem, "The Messiah."
He and his sister, two years older than himself, had often wept scalding tears over the story of Him who suffered death on the cross for us all.
On his first visit to Marbach, the town appeared to have changed but very little, and it was not far enough away to be forgotten.
The house, with its pointed gable, narrow windows, overhanging walls and stories, projecting one beyond another, looked just the same as in former times.
But in the churchyard there were several new graves; and there also, in the grass, close by the wall, stood the old church bell!
It had been taken down from its high position, in consequence of a crack in the metal which prevented it from ever chiming again, and a new bell now occupied its place.
The mother and son were walking in the churchyard when they discovered the old bell, and they stood still to look at it.
Then the mother reminded her little boy of what a useful bell this had been for many hundred years.
It had chimed for weddings and for christenings; it had tolled for funerals, and to give the alarm in case of fire.
With every event in the life of man the bell had made its voice heard.
His mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her.
And the boy gazed on the large, old bell with the deepest interest.
He bowed his head over it and kissed it, old, thrown away, and cracked as it was, and standing there amidst the grass and nettles.
The boy never forgot what his mother told him, and the tones of the old bell reverberated in his heart till he reached manhood.
In such sweet remembrance was the old bell cherished by the boy, who grew up in poverty to be tall and slender, with a freckled complexion and hair almost red; but his eyes were clear and blue as the deep sea, and what was his career to be?
His career was to be good, and his future life enviable.
We find him taking high honors at the military school in the division commanded by the member of a family high in position, and this was an honor, that is to say, good luck.
He wore gaiters, stiff collars, and powdered hair, and by this he was recognized; and, indeed, he might be known by the word of command- "March! halt! front!"
The old church bell had long been quite forgotten, and no one imagined it would ever again be sent to the melting furnace to make it as it was before.
No one could possibly have foretold this.
Equally impossible would it have been to believe that the tones of the old bell still echoed in the heart of the boy from Marbach; or that one day they would ring out loud enough and strong enough to be heard all over the world.
They had already been heard in the narrow space behind the school-wall, even above the deafening sounds of "March! halt! front!"
They had chimed so loudly in the heart of the youngster, that he had sung them to his companions, and their tones resounded to the very borders of the country.
He was not a free scholar in the military school, neither was he provided with clothes or food.
But he had his number, and his own peg; for everything here was ordered like clockwork, which we all know is of the greatest utility- people get on so much better together when their position and duties are understood.
It is by pressure that a jewel is stamped.
The pressure of regularity and discipline here stamped the jewel, which in the future the world so well knew.
In the chief town of the province a great festival was being celebrated.
The light streamed forth from thousands of lamps, and the rockets shot upwards towards the sky, filling the air with showers of colored fiery sparks.
A record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow.
He had dared to attempt to reach foreign territories unnoticed, and must therefore give up fatherland, mother, his dearest friends, all, or sink down into the stream of common life.
The old church bell had still some comfort; it stood in the shelter of the church wall in Marbach, once so elevated, now quite forgotten.
The wind roared around it, and could have readily related the story of its origin and of its sweet chimes, and the wind could also tell of him to whom he had brought fresh air when, in the woods of a neighboring country, he had sunk down exhausted with fatigue, with no other worldly possessions than hope for the future, and a written leaf from "Fiesco."
The wind could have told that his only protector was an artist, who, by reading each leaf to him, made it plain; and that they amused themselves by playing at nine-pins together.
The wind could also describe the pale fugitive, who, for weeks and months, lay in a wretched little road-side inn, where the landlord got drunk and raved, and where the merry-makers had it all their own way.
And he, the pale fugitive, sang of the ideal.
For many heavy days and dark nights the heart must suffer to enable it to endure trial and temptation; yet, amidst it all, would the minstrel sing.
Dark days and cold nights also passed over the old bell, and it noticed them not; but the bell in the man's heart felt it to be a gloomy time.
What would become of this young man, and what would become of the old bell?
The old bell was, after a time, carried away to a greater distance than any one, even the warder in the bell tower, ever imagined; and the bell in the breast of the young man was heard in countries where his feet had never wandered.
The tones went forth over the wide ocean to every part of the round world.
We will now follow the career of the old bell.
It was, as we have said, carried far away from Marbach and sold as old copper; then sent to Bavaria to be melted down in a furnace.
And then what happened?
In the royal city of Bavaria, many years after the bell had been removed from the tower and melted down, some metal was required for a monument in honor of one of the most celebrated characters which a German people or a German land could produce.
And now we see how wonderfully things are ordered.
Strange things sometimes happen in this world.
In Denmark, in one of those green islands where the foliage of the beech-woods rustles in the wind, and where many Huns' graves may be seen, was another poor boy born.
He wore wooden shoes, and when his father worked in a ship-yard, the boy, wrapped up in an old worn-out shawl, carried his dinner to him every day.
This poor child was now the pride of his country; for the sculptured marble, the work of his hands, had astonished the world.* To him was offered the honor of forming from the clay, a model of the figure of him whose name, "John Christopher Frederick," had been written by his father in the Bible.
The bust was cast in bronze, and part of the metal used for this purpose was the old church bell, whose tones had died away from the memory of those at home and elsewhere.
The metal, glowing with heat, flowed into the mould, and formed the head and bust of the statue which was unveiled in the square in front of the old castle.
The statue represented in living, breathing reality, the form of him who was born in poverty, the boy from Marbach, the pupil of the military school, the fugitive who struggled against poverty and oppression, from the outer world; Germany's great and immortal poet, who sung of Switzerland's deliverer, William Tell, and of the heaven-inspired Maid of Orleans.
* The Danish sculptor Thorwaldsen.
It was a beautiful sunny day; flags were waving from tower and roof in royal Stuttgart, and the church bells were ringing a joyous peal.
One bell was silent; but it was illuminated by the bright sunshine which streamed from the head and bust of the renowned figure, of which it formed a part.
On this day, just one hundred years had passed since the day on which the chiming of the old church bell at Marbach had filled the mother's heart with trust and joy- the day on which her child was born in poverty, and in a humble home; the same who, in after-years, became rich, became the noble woman-hearted poet, a blessing to the world- the glorious, the sublime, the immortal bard, John Christoper Frederick Schiller!
IN a house, with a large courtyard, in a provincial town, at that time of the year in which people say the evenings are growing longer, a family circle were gathered together at their old home.
A lamp burned on the table, although the weather was mild and warm, and the long curtains hung down before the open windows, and without the moon shone brightly in the dark-blue sky.
But they were not talking of the moon, but of a large, old stone that lay below in the courtyard not very far from the kitchen door.
The maids often laid the clean copper saucepans and kitchen vessels on this stone, that they might dry in the sun, and the children were fond of playing on it.
It was, in fact, an old grave-stone.
"Yes," said the master of the house, "I believe the stone came from the graveyard of the old church of the convent which was pulled down, and the pulpit, the monuments, and the grave-stones sold.
My father bought the latter; most of them were cut in two and used for paving-stones, but that one stone was preserved whole, and laid in the courtyard."
"Any one can see that it is a grave-stone," said the eldest of the children; "the representation of an hour-glass and part of the figure of an angel can still be traced, but the inscription beneath is quite worn out, excepting the name 'Preben,' and a large 'S' close by it, and a little farther down the name of 'Martha' can be easily read.
But nothing more, and even that cannot be seen unless it has been raining, or when we have washed the stone."
"Dear me! how singular.
Why that must be the grave-stone of Preben Schwane and his wife."
The old man who said this looked old enough to be the grandfather of all present in the room.
"Yes," he continued, "these people were among the last who were buried in the churchyard of the old convent.
They were a very worthy old couple, I can remember them well in the days of my boyhood.
Every one knew them, and they were esteemed by all.
They were the oldest residents in the town, and people said they possessed a ton of gold, yet they were always very plainly dressed, in the coarsest stuff, but with linen of the purest whiteness.
Preben and Martha were a fine old couple, and when they both sat on the bench, at the top of the steep stone steps, in front of their house, with the branches of the linden-tree waving above them, and nodded in a gentle, friendly way to passers by, it really made one feel quite happy.
They were very good to the poor; they fed them and clothed them, and in their benevolence there was judgment as well as true Christianity.
The old woman died first; that day is still quite vividly before my eyes.
I was a little boy, and had accompanied my father to the old man's house.
Martha had fallen into the sleep of death just as we arrived there.
The corpse lay in a bedroom, near to the one in which we sat, and the old man was in great distress and weeping like a child.
He spoke to my father, and to a few neighbors who were there, of how lonely he should feel now she was gone, and how good and true she, his dead wife, had been during the number of years that they had passed through life together, and how they had become acquainted, and learnt to love each other.
I was, as I have said, a boy, and only stood by and listened to what the others said; but it filled me with a strange emotion to listen to the old man, and to watch how the color rose in his cheeks as he spoke of the days of their courtship, of how beautiful she was, and how many little tricks he had been guilty of, that he might meet her.
And then he talked of his wedding-day; and his eyes brightened, and he seemed to be carried back, by his words, to that joyful time.
And yet there she was, lying in the next room, dead- an old woman, and he was an old man, speaking of the days of hope, long passed away.
Ah, well, so it is; then I was but a child, and now I am old, as old as Preben Schwane then was.
Time passes away, and all things changed.
I can remember quite well the day on which she was buried, and how Old Preben walked close behind the coffin.
"A few years before this time the old couple had had their grave-stone prepared, with an inscription and their names, but not the date.
In the evening the stone was taken to the churchyard, and laid on the grave.
A year later it was taken up, that Old Preben might be laid by the side of his wife.
They did not leave behind them wealth, they left behind them far less than people had believed they possessed; what there was went to families distantly related to them, of whom, till then, no one had ever heard.
The old house, with its balcony of wickerwork, and the bench at the top of the high steps, under the lime-tree, was considered, by the road-inspectors, too old and rotten to be left standing.
Afterwards, when the same fate befell the convent church, and the graveyard was destroyed, the grave-stone of Preben and Martha, like everything else, was sold to whoever would buy it.
And so it happened that this stone was not cut in two as many others had been, but now lies in the courtyard below, a scouring block for the maids, and a playground for the children.
The paved street now passes over the resting place of Old Preben and his wife; no one thinks of them any more now."
And the old man who had spoken of all this shook his head mournfully, and said, "Forgotten!
Ah, yes, everything will be forgotten!"
And then the conversation turned on other matters.
But the youngest child in the room, a boy, with large, earnest eyes, mounted upon a chair behind the window curtains, and looked out into the yard, where the moon was pouring a flood of light on the old gravestone,- the stone that had always appeared to him so dull and flat, but which lay there now like a great leaf out of a book of history.
All that the boy had heard of Old Preben and his wife seemed clearly defined on the stone, and as he gazed on it, and glanced at the clear, bright moon shining in the pure air, it was as if the light of God's countenance beamed over His beautiful world.
"Forgotten!
Everything will be forgotten!" still echoed through the room, and in the same moment an invisible spirit whispered to the heart of the boy, "Preserve carefully the seed that has been entrusted to thee, that it may grow and thrive.
Guard it well.
Through thee, my child, shall the obliterated inscription on the old, weather-beaten grave-stone go forth to future generations in clear, golden characters.
The old pair shall again wander through the streets arm-in-arm, or sit with their fresh, healthy cheeks on the bench under the lime-tree, and smile and nod at rich and poor.
The seed of this hour shall ripen in the course of years into a beautiful poem.
The beautiful and the good are never forgotten, they live always in story or in song."
A VERY old house stood once in a street with several that were quite new and clean.
The date of its erection had been carved on one of the beams, and surrounded by scrolls formed of tulips and hop-tendrils; by this date it could be seen that the old house was nearly three hundred years old.
Verses too were written over the windows in old-fashioned letters, and grotesque faces, curiously carved, grinned at you from under the cornices.
One story projected a long way over the other, and under the roof ran a leaden gutter, with a dragon's head at the end.
The rain was intended to pour out at the dragon's mouth, but it ran out of his body instead, for there was a hole in the gutter.
The other houses in the street were new and well built, with large window panes and smooth walls.
Any one could see they had nothing to do with the old house.
Perhaps they thought, "How long will that heap of rubbish remain here to be a disgrace to the whole street.
The parapet projects so far forward that no one can see out of our windows what is going on in that direction.
The stairs are as broad as the staircase of a castle, and as steep as if they led to a church-tower.
The iron railing looks like the gate of a cemetery, and there are brass knobs upon it.
It is really too ridiculous."
Opposite to the old house were more nice new houses, which had just the same opinion as their neighbors.
At the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks, and clear sparkling eyes, who was very fond of the old house, in sunshine or in moonlight.
He would sit and look at the wall from which the plaster had in some places fallen off, and fancy all sorts of scenes which had been in former times.
How the street must have looked when the houses had all gable roofs, open staircases, and gutters with dragons at the spout.
He could even see soldiers walking about with halberds.
Certainly it was a very good house to look at for amusement.
An old man lived in it, who wore knee-breeches, a coat with large brass buttons, and a wig, which any one could see was a real wig.
Every morning an old man came to clean the rooms, and to wait upon him, otherwise the old man in the knee-breeches would have been quite alone in the house.
Sometimes he came to one of the windows and looked out; then the little boy nodded to him, and the old man nodded back again, till they became acquainted, and were friends, although they had never spoken to each other; but that was of no consequence.
The little boy one day heard his parents say, "The old man opposite is very well off, but is terribly lonely."
The next Sunday morning the little boy wrapped something in a piece of paper and took it to the door of the old house, and said to the attendant who waited upon the old man, "Will you please give this from me to the gentleman who lives here; I have two tin soldiers, and this is one of them, and he shall have it, because I know he is terribly lonely."
And the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and then he carried the tin soldier into the house.
Afterwards he was sent over to ask the little boy if he would not like to pay a visit himself.
His parents gave him permission, and so it was that he gained admission to the old house.
The brassy knobs on the railings shone more brightly than ever, as if they had been polished on account of his visit; and on the door were carved trumpeters standing in tulips, and it seemed as if they were blowing with all their might, their cheeks were so puffed out.
"Tanta-ra-ra, the little boy is coming; Tanta-ra-ra, the little boy is coming."
Then the door opened.
All round the hall hung old portraits of knights in armor, and ladies in silk gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silk dresses rustled.
Then came a staircase which went up a long way, and then came down a little way and led to a balcony, which was in a very ruinous state.
There were large holes and long cracks, out of which grew grass and leaves, indeed the whole balcony, the courtyard, and the walls were so overgrown with green that they looked like a garden.
In the balcony stood flower-pots, on which were heads having asses' ears, but the flowers in them grew just as they pleased.
In one pot pinks were growing all over the sides, at least the green leaves were shooting forth stalk and stem, and saying as plainly as they could speak, "The air has fanned me, the sun has kissed me, and I am promised a little flower for next Sunday- really for next Sunday."
Then they entered a room in which the walls were covered with leather, and the leather had golden flowers stamped upon it.
"Gilding will fade in damp weather, To endure, there is nothing like leather,"
said the walls.
Chairs handsomely carved, with elbows on each side, and with very high backs, stood in the room, and as they creaked they seemed to say, "Sit down.
Oh dear, how I am creaking.
I shall certainly have the gout like the old cupboard.
Gout in my back, ugh."
And then the little boy entered the room where the old man sat.
"Thank you for the tin soldier my little friend," said the old man, "and thank you also for coming to see me."
"Thanks, thanks," or "Creak, creak," said all the furniture.
There was so much that the pieces of furniture stood in each other's way to get a sight of the little boy.
On the wall near the centre of the room hung the picture of a beautiful lady, young and gay, dressed in the fashion of the olden times, with powdered hair, and a full, stiff skirt.
She said neither "thanks" nor "creak," but she looked down upon the little boy with her mild eyes; and then he said to the old man, "Where did you get that picture?"
"From the shop opposite," he replied.
"Many portraits hang there that none seem to trouble themselves about.
The persons they represent have been dead and buried long since.
But I knew this lady many years ago, and she has been dead nearly half a century."
Under a glass beneath the picture hung a nosegay of withered flowers, which were no doubt half a century old too, at least they appeared so.
And the pendulum of the old clock went to and fro, and the hands turned round; and as time passed on, everything in the room grew older, but no one seemed to notice it.
"They say at home," said the little boy, "that you are very lonely."
"Oh," replied the old man, "I have pleasant thoughts of all that has passed, recalled by memory; and now you are come to visit me, and that is very pleasant."
Then he took from the book-case, a book full of pictures representing long processions of wonderful coaches, such as are never seen at the present time.
Soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens with waving banners.
The tailors had a flag with a pair of scissors supported by two lions, and on the shoemakers' flag there were not boots, but an eagle with two heads, for the shoemakers must have everything arranged so that they can say, "This is a pair."
What a picture-book it was; and then the old man went into another room to fetch apples and nuts.
It was very pleasant, certainly, to be in that old house.
"I cannot endure it," said the tin soldier, who stood on a shelf, "it is so lonely and dull here.
I have been accustomed to live in a family, and I cannot get used to this life.
I cannot bear it.
The whole day is long enough, but the evening is longer.
It is not here like it was in your house opposite, when your father and mother talked so cheerfully together, while you and all the dear children made such a delightful noise.
No, it is all lonely in the old man's house.
Do you think he gets any kisses?
Do you think he ever has friendly looks, or a Christmas tree?
He will have nothing now but the grave.
Oh, I cannot bear it."
"You must not look only on the sorrowful side," said the little boy; "I think everything in this house is beautiful, and all the old pleasant thoughts come back here to pay visits."
"Ah, but I never see any, and I don't know them," said the tin soldier, "and I cannot bear it."
"You must bear it," said the little boy.
Then the old man came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought no more of the tin soldier.
How happy and delighted the little boy was; and after he returned home, and while days and weeks passed, a great deal of nodding took place from one house to the other, and then the little boy went to pay another visit.
The carved trumpeters blew "Tanta-ra-ra. There is the little boy.
Tanta-ra-ra."
The swords and armor on the old knight's pictures rattled.
The silk dresses rustled, the leather repeated its rhyme, and the old chairs had the gout in their backs, and cried, "Creak;" it was all exactly like the first time; for in that house, one day and one hour were just like another.
"I cannot bear it any longer," said the tin soldier; "I have wept tears of tin, it is so melancholy here.
Let me go to the wars, and lose an arm or a leg, that would be some change; I cannot bear it.
Now I know what it is to have visits from one's old recollections, and all they bring with them.
I have had visits from mine, and you may believe me it is not altogether pleasant.
I was very nearly jumping from the shelf.
I saw you all in your house opposite, as if you were really present.
It was Sunday morning, and you children stood round the table, singing the hymn that you sing every morning.
You were standing quietly, with your hands folded, and your father and mother.
You were standing quietly, with your hands folded, and your father and mother were looking just as serious, when the door opened, and your little sister Maria, who is not two years old, was brought into the room.
You know she always dances when she hears music and singing of any sort; so she began to dance immediately, although she ought not to have done so, but she could not get into the right time because the tune was so slow; so she stood first on one leg and then on the other, and bent her head very low, but it would not suit the music.
You all stood looking very grave, although it was very difficult to do so, but I laughed so to myself that I fell down from the table, and got a bruise, which is there still; I know it was not right to laugh.
So all this, and everything else that I have seen, keeps running in my head, and these must be the old recollections that bring so many thoughts with them.
Tell me whether you still sing on Sundays, and tell me about your little sister Maria, and how my old comrade is, the other tin soldier.
Ah, really he must be very happy; I cannot endure this life."
"You are given away," said the little boy; "you must stay.
Don't you see that?"
Then the old man came in, with a box containing many curious things to show him.
Rouge-pots, scent-boxes, and old cards, so large and so richly gilded, that none are ever seen like them in these days.
And there were smaller boxes to look at, and the piano was opened, and inside the lid were painted landscapes.
But when the old man played, the piano sounded quite out of tune.
Then he looked at the picture he had bought at the broker's, and his eyes sparkled brightly as he nodded at it, and said, "Ah, she could sing that tune."
"I will go to the wars!
I will go to the wars!" cried the tin soldier as loud as he could, and threw himself down on the floor.
Where could he have fallen?
The old man searched, and the little boy searched, but he was gone, and could not be found.
"I shall find him again," said the old man, but he did not find him.
The boards of the floor were open and full of holes.
The tin soldier had fallen through a crack between the boards, and lay there now in an open grave.
The day went by, and the little boy returned home; the week passed, and many more weeks.
It was winter, and the windows were quite frozen, so the little boy was obliged to breathe on the panes, and rub a hole to peep through at the old house.
Snow drifts were lying in all the scrolls and on the inscriptions, and the steps were covered with snow as if no one were at home.
And indeed nobody was home, for the old man was dead.
In the evening, a hearse stopped at the door, and the old man in his coffin was placed in it.
He was to be taken to the country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him, for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it.
A few days after, there was an auction at the old house, and from his window the little boy saw the people carrying away the pictures of old knights and ladies, the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the cup-boards.
Some were taken one way, some another.
Her portrait, which had been bought at the picture dealer's, went back again to his shop, and there it remained, for no one seemed to know her, or to care for the old picture.
In the spring; they began to pull the house itself down; people called it complete rubbish.
From the street could be seen the room in which the walls were covered with leather, ragged and torn, and the green in the balcony hung straggling over the beams; they pulled it down quickly, for it looked ready to fall, and at last it was cleared away altogether.
"What a good riddance," said the neighbors' houses.
Very shortly, a fine new house was built farther back from the road; it had lofty windows and smooth walls, but in front, on the spot where the old house really stood, a little garden was planted, and wild vines grew up over the neighboring walls; in front of the garden were large iron railings and a great gate, which looked very stately.
People used to stop and peep through the railings.
The sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together as loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents were very proud of him.
He was just married, and had come, with his young wife, to reside in the new house with the garden in front of it, and now he stood there by her side while she planted a field flower that she thought very pretty.
She was planting it herself with her little hands, and pressing down the earth with her fingers.
"Oh dear, what was that?" she exclaimed, as something pricked her.
Out of the soft earth something was sticking up.
It was- only think!- it was really the tin soldier, the very same which had been lost up in the old man's room, and had been hidden among old wood and rubbish for a long time, till it sunk into the earth, where it must have been for many years.
And the young wife wiped the soldier, first with a green leaf, and then with her fine pocket-handkerchief, that smelt of such beautiful perfume.
And the tin soldier felt as if he was recovering from a fainting fit.
"Let me see him," said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, "It can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when I was a little boy."
And then he told his wife about the old house and the old man, and of the tin soldier which he had sent across, because he thought the old man was lonely; and he related the story so clearly that tears came into the eyes of the young wife for the old house and the old man.
"It is very likely that this is really the same soldier," said she, and I will take care of him, and always remember what you have told me; but some day you must show me the old man's grave."
"I don't know where it is," he replied; "no one knows.
All his friends are dead; no one took care of him, and I was only a little boy."
"Oh, how dreadfully lonely he must have been," said she.
"Yes, terribly lonely," cried the tin soldier; "still it is delightful not to be forgotten."
"Delightful indeed," cried a voice quite near to them; no one but the tin soldier saw that it came from a rag of the leather which hung in tatters; it had lost all its gilding, and looked like wet earth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it thus:-
"Gilding will fade in damp weather, To endure, there is nothing like leather."
But the tin soldier did not believe any such thing.
IT is winter-time.
The earth wears a snowy garment, and looks like marble hewn out of the rock; the air is bright and clear; the wind is sharp as a well-tempered sword, and the trees stand like branches of white coral or blooming almond twigs, and here it is keen as on the lofty Alps.
The night is splendid in the gleam of the Northern Lights, and in the glitter of innumerable twinkling stars.
But we sit in the warm room, by the hot stove, and talk about the old times.
And we listen to this story: By the open sea was a giant's grave; and on the grave-mound sat at midnight the spirit of the buried hero, who had been a king.
The golden circlet gleamed on his brow, his hair fluttered in the wind, and he was clad in steel and iron.
He bent his head mournfully, and sighed in deep sorrow, as an unquiet spirit might sigh.
And a ship came sailing by.
Presently the sailors lowered the anchor and landed.
Among them was a singer, and he approached the royal spirit, and said, "Why mournest thou, and wherefore dost thou suffer thus?"
And the dead man answered, "No one has sung the deeds of my life; they are dead and forgotten.
Song doth not carry them forth over the lands, nor into the hearts of men; therefore I have no rest and no peace."
And he spoke of his works, and of his warlike deeds, which his contemporaries had known, but which had not been sung, because there was no singer among his companions.
Then the old bard struck the strings of his harp, and sang of the youthful courage of the hero, of the strength of the man, and of the greatness of his good deeds.
Then the face of the dead one gleamed like the margin of the cloud in the moonlight.
Gladly and of good courage, the form arose in splendor and in majesty, and vanished like the glancing of the northern light.
Nought was to be seen but the green turfy mound, with the stones on which no Runic record has been graven; but at the last sound of the harp there soared over the hill, as though he had fluttered from the harp, a little bird, a charming singing-bird, with ringing voice of the thrush, with the moving voice pathos of the human heart, with a voice that told of home, like the voice that is heard by the bird of passage.
The singing-bird soared away, over mountain and valley, over field and wood- he was the Bird of Popular Song, who never dies.
We hear his song- we hear it now in the room while the white bees are swarming without, and the storm clutches the windows.
The bird sings not alone the requiem of heroes; he sings also sweet gentle songs of love, so many and so warm, of Northern fidelity and truth.
He has stories in words and in tones; he has proverbs and snatches of proverbs; songs which, like Runes laid under a dead man's tongue, force him to speak; and thus Popular Song tells of the land of his birth.
In the old heathen days, in the times of the Vikings, the popular speech was enshrined in the harp of the bard.
In the days of knightly castles, when the strongest fist held the scales of justice, when only might was right, and a peasant and a dog were of equal importance, where did the Bird of Song find shelter and protection?
Neither violence nor stupidity gave him a thought.
But in the gabled window of the knightly castle, the lady of the castle sat with the parchment roll before her, and wrote down the old recollections in song and legend, while near her stood the old woman from the wood, and the travelling peddler who went wandering through the country.
As these told their tales, there fluttered around them, with twittering and song, the Bird of Popular Song, who never dies so long as the earth has a hill upon which his foot may rest.
And now he looks in upon us and sings.
Without are the night and the snow-storm.
He lays the Runes beneath our tongues, and we know the land of our home.
Heaven speaks to us in our native tongue, in the voice of the Bird of Popular Song.
The old remembrances awake, the faded colors glow with a fresh lustre, and story and song pour us a blessed draught which lifts up our minds and our thoughts, so that the evening becomes as a Christmas festival.
The snow-flakes chase each other, the ice cracks, the storm rules without, for he has the might, he is lord- but not the LORD OF ALL.
It is winter time.
The wind is sharp as a two-edged sword, the snow-flakes chase each other; it seems as though it had been snowing for days and weeks, and the snow lies like a great mountain over the whole town, like a heavy dream of the winter night.
Everything on the earth is hidden away, only the golden cross of the church, the symbol of faith, arises over the snow grave, and gleams in the blue air and in the bright sunshine.
And over the buried town fly the birds of heaven, the small and the great; they twitter and they sing as best they may, each bird with his beak.
First comes the band of sparrows: they pipe at every trifle in the streets and lanes, in the nests and the houses; they have stories to tell about the front buildings and the back buildings.
"We know the buried town," they say; "everything living in it is piep! piep! piep!"
The black ravens and crows flew on over the white snow.
"Grub, grub!" they cried.
"There's something to be got down there; something to swallow, and that's most important.
That's the opinion of most of them down there, and the opinion is goo-goo-good!"
The wild swans come flying on whirring pinions, and sing of the noble and the great, that will still sprout in the hearts of men, down in the town which is resting beneath its snowy veil.
No death is there- life reigns yonder; we hear it on the notes that swell onward like the tones of the church organ, which seize us like sounds from the elf-hill, like the songs of Ossian, like the rushing swoop of the wandering spirits' wings.
What harmony!
That harmony speaks to our hearts, and lifts up our souls!
It is the Bird of Popular Song whom we hear.
And at this moment the warm breath of heaven blows down from the sky.
There are gaps in the snowy mountains, the sun shines into the clefts; spring is coming, the birds are returning, and new races are coming with the same home sounds in their hearts.
Hear the story of the year: "The night of the snow-storm, the heavy dream of the winter night, all shall be dissolved, all shall rise again in the beauteous notes of the Bird of Popular Song, who never dies!"
A DUCK once arrived from Portugal, but there were some who said she came from Spain, which is almost the same thing.
At all events, she was called the "Portuguese," and she laid eggs, was killed, and cooked, and there was an end of her.
But the ducklings which crept forth from the eggs were also called "Portuguese," and about that there may be some question.
But of all the family one only remained in the duckyard, which may be called a farmyard, as the chickens were admitted, and the cock strutted about in a very hostile manner.
"He annoys me with his loud crowing," said the Portuguese duck; "but, still, he's a handsome bird, there's no denying that, although he's not a drake.
He ought to moderate his voice, like those little birds who are singing in the lime-trees over there in our neighbor's garden, but that is an art only acquired in polite society.
How sweetly they sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them!
I call it Portuguese singing.
If I had only such a little singing-bird, I'd be kind and good as a mother to him, for it's in my nature, in my Portuguese blood."
While she was speaking, one of the little singing-birds came tumbling head over heels from the roof into the yard.
The cat was after him, but he had escaped from her with a broken wing, and so came tumbling into the yard.
"That's just like the cat, she's a villain," said the Portuguese duck.
"I remember her ways when I had children of my own.
How can such a creature be allowed to live, and wander about upon the roofs.
I don't think they allow such things in Portugal."
She pitied the little singing-bird, and so did all the other ducks who were not Portuguese.
"Poor little creature!" they said, one after another, as they came up.
"We can't sing, certainly; but we have a sounding-board, or something of the kind, within us; we can feel that, though we don't talk about it."
"But I can talk," said the Portuguese duck; "and I'll do something for the little fellow; it's my duty;" and she stepped into the water-trough, and beat her wings upon the water so strongly that the bird was nearly drowned by a shower-bath; but the duck meant it kindly.
"That is a good deed," she said; "I hope the others will take example by it."
"Tweet, tweet!" said the little bird, for one of his wings being broken, he found it difficult to shake himself; but he quite understood that the bath was meant kindly, and he said, "You are very kind-hearted, madam;" but he did not wish for a second bath.
"I have never thought about my heart," replied the Portuguese duck, "but I know that I love all my fellow-creatures, except the cat, and nobody can expect me to love her, for she ate up two of my ducklings.
But pray make yourself at home; it is easy to make one's self comfortable.
I am myself from a foreign country, as you may see by my feathery dress.
My drake is a native of these parts; he's not of my race; but I am not proud on that account.
If any one here can understand you, I may say positively I am that person."
"She's quite full of 'Portulak,'" said a little common duck, who was witty.
All the common ducks considered the word "Portulak" a good joke, for it sounded like Portugal.
They nudged each other, and said, "Quack! that was witty!"
Then the other ducks began to notice the little bird.
"The Portuguese had certainly a great flow of language," they said to the little bird.
"For our part we don't care to fill our beaks with such long words, but we sympathize with you quite as much.
If we don't do anything else, we can walk about with you everywhere, and we think that is the best thing we can do."
"You have a lovely voice," said one of the eldest ducks; "it must be great satisfaction to you to be able to give so much pleasure as you do.
I am certainly no judge of your singing so I keep my beak shut, which is better than talking nonsense, as others do."
"Don't plague him so, interposed the Portuguese duck; "he requires rest and nursing.
My little singing-bird do you wish me to prepare another bath for you?"
"Oh, no! no! pray let me dry," implored the little bird.
"The water-cure is the only remedy for me, when I am not well," said the Portuguese.
"Amusement, too, is very beneficial.
The fowls from the neighborhood will soon be here to pay you a visit.
There are two Cochin Chinese amongst them; they wear feathers on their legs, and are well educated.
They have been brought from a great distance, and consequently I treat them with greater respect than I do the others."
Then the fowls arrived, and the cock was polite enough to-day to keep from being rude.
"You are a real songster," he said, "you do as much with your little voice as it is possible to do; but there requires more noise and shrillness in any one who wishes it to be known who he is."
The two Chinese were quite enchanted with the appearance of the singing-bird.
His feathers had been much ruffled by his bath, so that he seemed to them quite like a tiny Chinese fowl.
"He's charming," they said to each other, and began a conversation with him in whispers, using the most aristocratic Chinese dialect: "We are of the same race as yourself," they said.
"The ducks, even the Portuguese, are all aquatic birds, as you must have noticed.
You do not know us yet,- very few know us, or give themselves the trouble to make our acquaintance, not even any of the fowls, though we are born to occupy a higher grade in society than most of them.
But that does not disturb us, we quietly go on in our own way among the rest, whose ideas are certainly not ours; for we look at the bright side of things, and only speak what is good, although that is sometimes very difficult to find where none exists.
Except ourselves and the cock there is not one in the yard who can be called talented or polite.
It cannot even be said of the ducks, and we warn you, little bird, not to trust that one yonder, with the short tail feathers, for she is cunning; that curiously marked one, with the crooked stripes on her wings, is a mischief-maker, and never lets any one have the last word, though she is always in the wrong.
That fat duck yonder speaks evil of every one, and that is against our principles.
If we have nothing good to tell, we close our beaks.
The Portuguese is the only one who has had any education, and with whom we can associate, but she is passionate, and talks too much about 'Portugal.'"
"I wonder what those two Chinese are whispering about," whispered one duck to another; "they are always doing it, and it annoys me.
We never speak to them."
Now the drake came up, and he thought the little singing-bird was a sparrow.
"Well, I don't understand the difference," he said; "it appears to me all the same.
He's only a plaything, and if people will have playthings, why let them, I say."
"Don't take any notice of what he says," whispered the Portuguese; "he's very well in matters of business, and with him business is placed before everything.
But now I shall lie down and have a little rest.
It is a duty we owe to ourselves that we may be nice and fat when we come to be embalmed with sage and onions and apples."
So she laid herself down in the sun and winked with one eye; she had a very comfortable place, and felt so comfortable that she fell asleep.
The little singing-bird busied himself for some time with his broken wing, and at last he lay down, too, quite close to his protectress.
The sun shone warm and bright, and he found out that it was a very good place.
But the fowls of the neighborhood were all awake, and, to tell the truth, they had paid a visit to the duckyard, simply and solely to find food for themselves.
The Chinese were the first to leave, and the other fowls soon followed them.
The witty little duck said of the Portuguese, that the old lady was getting quite a "doting ducky," All the other ducks laughed at this.
"Doting ducky," they whispered.
"Oh, that's too 'witty!'"
And then they repeated the former joke about "Portulak," and declared it was most amusing.
Then they all lay down to have a nap.
They had been lying asleep for some time, when suddenly something was thrown into the yard for them to eat.
It came down with such a bang, that the whole company started up and clapped their wings.
The Portuguese awoke too, and rushed over to the other side: in so doing she trod upon the little singing-bird.
"Tweet," he cried; "you trod very hard upon me, madam."
"Well, then, why do you lie in my way?" she retorted, "you must not be so touchy.
I have nerves of my own, but I do not cry 'tweet.'"
"Don't be angry," said the little bird; "the 'tweet' slipped out of my beak unawares."
The Portuguese did not listen to him, but began eating as fast as she could, and made a good meal.
When she had finished, she lay down again, and the little bird, who wished to be amiable, began to sing,-
"Chirp and twitter, The dew-drops glitter, In the hours of sunny spring, I'll sing my best, Till I go to rest, With my head behind my wing."
"Now I want rest after my dinner," said the Portuguese; "you must conform to the rules of the house while you are here.
I want to sleep now."
The little bird was quite taken aback, for he meant it kindly.
When madam awoke afterwards, there he stood before her with a little corn he had found, and laid it at her feet; but as she had not slept well, she was naturally in a bad temper.
"Give that to a chicken," she said, "and don't be always standing in my way."
"Why are you angry with me?" replied the little singing-bird, "what have I done?"
"Done!" repeated the Portuguese duck, "your mode of expressing yourself is not very polite.
I must call your attention to that fact."
"It was sunshine here yesterday," said the little bird, "but to-day it is cloudy and the air is close."
"You know very little about the weather, I fancy," she retorted, "the day is not over yet.
Don't stand there, looking so stupid."
"But you are looking at me just as the wicked eyes looked when I fell into the yard yesterday."
"Impertinent creature!" exclaimed the Portuguese duck: "would you compare me with the cat- that beast of prey?
There's not a drop of malicious blood in me.
I've taken your part, and now I'll teach you better manners."
So saying, she made a bite at the little singing-bird's head, and he fell dead on the ground.
"Now whatever is the meaning of this?"
"she said; "could he not bear even such a little peck as I gave him?
Then certainly he was not made for this world.
I've been like a mother to him, I know that, for I've a good heart."
Then the cock from the neighboring yard stuck his head in, and crowed with steam-engine power.
"You'll kill me with your crowing," she cried, "it's all your fault.
He's lost his life, and I'm very near losing mine."
"There's not much of him lying there," observed the cock.
"Speak of him with respect," said the Portuguese duck, "for he had manners and education, and he could sing.
He was affectionate and gentle, and that is as rare a quality in animals as in those who call themselves human beings."
Then all the ducks came crowding round the little dead bird.
Ducks have strong passions, whether they feel envy or pity.
There was nothing to envy here, so they all showed a great deal of pity, even the two Chinese.
"We shall never have another singing-bird again amongst us; he was almost a Chinese," they whispered, and then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound, that all the other fowls clucked too, but the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards.
"We have hearts of our own," they said, "nobody can deny that."
"Hearts!" repeated the Portuguese, "indeed you have, almost as tender as the ducks in Portugal."
"Let us think of getting something to satisfy our hunger," said the drake, that's the most important business.
If one of our toys is broken, why we have plenty more."
A PRIZE, or rather two prizes, a great one and a small one, had been awarded for the greatest swiftness in running,- not in a single race, but for the whole year.
"I obtained the first prize," said the hare.
"Justice must still be carried out, even when one has relations and good friends among the prize committee; but that the snail should have received the second prize, I consider almost an insult to myself" "No," said the fence-rail, who had been a witness at the distribution of prizes; "there should be some consideration for industry and perseverance.
I have heard many respectable people say so, and I can quite understand it.
The snail certainly took half a year to get over the threshold of the door; but he injured himself, and broke his collar-bone by the haste he made.
He gave himself up entirely to the race, and ran with his house on his back, which was all, of course, very praiseworthy; and therefore he obtained the second prize."
"I think I ought to have had some consideration too," said the swallow.
"I should imagine no one can be swifter in soaring and flight than I am; and how far I have been! far, far away."
"Yes, that is your misfortune," said the fence-rail; "you are so fickle, so unsettled; you must always be travelling about into foreign lands when the cold commences here.
You have no love of fatherland in you.
There can be no consideration for you."
"But now, if I have been lying the whole winter in the moor," said the swallow, "and suppose I slept the whole time, would that be taken into account?"
"Bring a certificate from the old moor-hen," said he, "that you have slept away half your time in fatherland; then you will be treated with some consideration."
"I deserved the first prize, and not the second," said the snail.
"I know so much, at least, that the hare only ran from cowardice, and because he thought there was danger in delay.
I, on the other hand, made running the business of my life, and have become a cripple in the service.
If any one had a first prize, it ought to have been myself.
But I do not understand chattering and boasting; on the contrary, I despise it."
And the snail spat at them with contempt.
"I am able to affirm with word of oath, that each prize- at least, those for which I voted- was given with just and proper consideration," said the old boundary post in the wood, who was a member of the committee of judges.
"I always act with due order, consideration, and calculation.
Seven times have I already had the honor to be present at the distribution of the prizes, and to vote; but to-day is the first time I have been able to carry out my will.
I always reckon the first prize by going through the alphabet from the beginning, and the second by going through from the end.
Be so kind as to give me your attention, and I will explain to you how I reckon from the beginning.
The eighth letter from A is H, and there we have H for hare; therefore I awarded to the hare the first prize.
The eighth letter from the end of the alphabet is S, and therefore the snail received the second prize.
Next year, the letter I will have its turn for the first prize, and the letter R for the second."
"I should really have voted for myself," said the mule, "if I had not been one of the judges on the committee.
Not only the rapidity with which advance is made, but every other quality should have due consideration; as, for instance, how much weight a candidate is able to draw; but I have not brought this quality forward now, nor the sagacity of the hare in his flight, nor the cunning with which he suddenly springs aside and doubles, to lead people on a false track, thinking he has concealed himself.
No; there is something else on which more stress should be laid, and which ought not be left unnoticed.
I mean that which mankind call the beautiful.
It is on the beautiful that I particularly fix my eyes.
I observed the well-grown ears of the hare; it is a pleasure to me to observe how long they are.
It seemed as if I saw myself again in the days of my childhood; and so I voted for the hare."
"Buz," said the fly; "there, I'm not going to make a long speech; but I wish to say something about hares.
I have really overtaken more than one hare, when I have been seated on the engine in front of a railway train.
I often do so.
One can then so easily judge of one's own swiftness.
Not long ago, I crushed the hind legs of a young hare.
He had been running a long time before the engine; he had no idea that I was travelling there.
At last he had to stop in his career, and the engine ran over his hind legs, and crushed them; for I set upon it.
I left him lying there, and rode on farther.
I call that conquering him; but I do not want the prize."
"It really seems to me," thought the wild rose, though she did not express her opinion aloud- it is not in her nature to do so,- though it would have been quite as well if she had; "it certainly seems to me that the sunbeam ought to have had the honor of receiving the first prize.
The sunbeam flies in a few minutes along the immeasurable path from the sun to us.
It arrives in such strength, that all nature awakes to loveliness and beauty; we roses blush and exhale fragrance in its presence.
Our worshipful judges don't appear to have noticed this at all.
Were I the sunbeam, I would give each one of them a sun stroke; but that would only make them mad, and they are mad enough already.
I only hope," continued the rose, "that peace may reign in the wood.
It is glorious to bloom, to be fragrant, and to live; to live in story and in song.
The sunbeam will outlive us all."
"What is the first prize?" asked the earthworm, who had overslept the time, and only now came up.
"It contains a free admission to a cabbage-garden," replied the mule.
"I proposed that as one of the prizes.
The hare most decidedly must have it; and I, as an active and thoughtful member of the committee, took especial care that the prize should be one of advantage to him; so now he is provided for.
The snail can now sit on the fence, and lick up moss and sunshine.
He has also been appointed one of the first judges of swiftness in racing.
It is worth much to know that one of the numbers is a man of talent in the thing men call a 'committee.'
I must say I expect much in the future; we have already made such a good beginning."
ONCE upon a time there was little girl, pretty and dainty.
But in summer time she was obliged to go barefooted because she was poor, and in winter she had to wear large wooden shoes, so that her little instep grew quite red.
In the middle of the village lived an old shoemaker's wife; she sat down and made, as well as she could, a pair of little shoes out of some old pieces of red cloth.
They were clumsy, but she meant well, for they were intended for the little girl, whose name was Karen.
Karen received the shoes and wore them for the first time on the day of her mother's funeral.
They were certainly not suitable for mourning; but she had no others, and so she put her bare feet into them and walked behind the humble coffin.
Just then a large old carriage came by, and in it sat an old lady; she looked at the little girl, and taking pity on her, said to the clergyman, "Look here, if you will give me the little girl, I will take care of her."
Karen believed that this was all on account of the red shoes, but the old lady thought them hideous, and so they were burnt.
Karen herself was dressed very neatly and cleanly; she was taught to read and to sew, and people said that she was pretty.
But the mirror told her, "You are more than pretty- you are beautiful."
One day the Queen was travelling through that part of the country, and had her little daughter, who was a princess, with her.
All the people, amongst them Karen too, streamed towards the castle, where the little princess, in fine white clothes, stood before the window and allowed herself to be stared at.
She wore neither a train nor a golden crown, but beautiful red morocco shoes; they were indeed much finer than those which the shoemaker's wife had sewn for little Karen.
There is really nothing in the world that can be compared to red shoes!
Karen was now old enough to be confirmed; she received some new clothes, and she was also to have some new shoes.
The rich shoemaker in the town took the measure of her little foot in his own room, in which there stood great glass cases full of pretty shoes and white slippers.
It all looked very lovely, but the old lady could not see very well, and therefore did not get much pleasure out of it.
Amongst the shoes stood a pair of red ones, like those which the princess had worn.
How beautiful they were! and the shoemaker said that they had been made for a count's daughter, but that they had not fitted her.
"I suppose they are of shiny leather?" asked the old lady.
"They shine so."
"Yes, they do shine," said Karen.
They fitted her, and were bought.
But the old lady knew nothing of their being red, for she would never have allowed Karen to be confirmed in red shoes, as she was now to be.
Everybody looked at her feet, and the whole of the way from the church door to the choir it seemed to her as if even the ancient figures on the monuments, in their stiff collars and long black robes, had their eyes fixed on her red shoes.
It was only of these that she thought when the clergyman laid his hand upon her head and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with God, and told her that she was now to be a grown-up Christian.
The organ pealed forth solemnly, and the sweet children's voices mingled with that of their old leader; but Karen thought only of her red shoes.
In the afternoon the old lady heard from everybody that Karen had worn red shoes.
She said that it was a shocking thing to do, that it was very improper, and that Karen was always to go to church in future in black shoes, even if they were old.
On the following Sunday there was Communion.
Karen looked first at the black shoes, then at the red ones- looked at the red ones again, and put them on.
The sun was shining gloriously, so Karen and the old lady went along the footpath through the corn, where it was rather dusty.
At the church door stood an old crippled soldier leaning on a crutch; he had a wonderfully long beard, more red than white, and he bowed down to the ground and asked the old lady whether he might wipe her shoes.
Then Karen put out her little foot too.
"Dear me, what pretty dancing-shoes!" said the soldier.
"Sit fast, when you dance," said he, addressing the shoes, and slapping the soles with his hand.
The old lady gave the soldier some money and then went with Karen into the church.
And all the people inside looked at Karen's red shoes, and all the figures gazed at them; when Karen knelt before the altar and put the golden goblet to her mouth, she thought only of the red shoes.
It seemed to her as though they were swimming about in the goblet, and she forgot to sing the psalm, forgot to say the "Lord's Prayer."
Now every one came out of church, and the old lady stepped into her carriage.
But just as Karen was lifting up her foot to get in too, the old soldier said: "Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!" and Karen could not help it, she was obliged to dance a few steps; and when she had once begun, her legs continued to dance.
It seemed as if the shoes had got power over them.
She danced round the church corner, for she could not stop; the coachman had to run after her and seize her.
He lifted her into the carriage, but her feet continued to dance, so that she kicked the good old lady violently.
At last they took off her shoes, and her legs were at rest.
At home the shoes were put into the cupboard, but Karen could not help looking at them.
Now the old lady fell ill, and it was said that she would not rise from her bed again.
She had to be nursed and waited upon, and this was no one's duty more than Karen's.
But there was a grand ball in the town, and Karen was invited.
She looked at the red shoes, saying to herself that there was no sin in doing that; she put the red shoes on, thinking there was no harm in that either; and then she went to the ball; and commenced to dance.
But when she wanted to go to the right, the shoes danced to the left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced down the room, down the stairs through the street, and out through the gates of the town.
She danced, and was obliged to dance, far out into the dark wood.
Suddenly something shone up among the trees, and she believed it was the moon, for it was a face.
But it was the old soldier with the red beard; he sat there nodding his head and said: "Dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!"
She was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes away; but they stuck fast.
She tore off her stockings, but the shoes had grown fast to her feet.
She danced and was obliged to go on dancing over field and meadow, in rain and sunshine, by night and by day- but by night it was most horrible.
She danced out into the open churchyard; but the dead there did not dance.
They had something better to do than that.
She wanted to sit down on the pauper's grave where the bitter fern grows; but for her there was neither peace nor rest.
And as she danced past the open church door she saw an angel there in long white robes, with wings reaching from his shoulders down to the earth; his face was stern and grave, and in his hand he held a broad shining sword.
"Dance you shall," said he, "dance in your red shoes till you are pale and cold, till your skin shrivels up and you are a skeleton!
Dance you shall, from door to door, and where proud and wicked children live you shall knock, so that they may hear you and fear you!
Dance you shall, dance- !"
"Mercy!" cried Karen.
But she did not hear what the angel answered, for the shoes carried her through the gate into the fields, along highways and byways, and unceasingly she had to dance.
One morning she danced past a door that she knew well; they were singing a psalm inside, and a coffin was being carried out covered with flowers.
Then she knew that she was forsaken by every one and damned by the angel of God.
She danced, and was obliged to go on dancing through the dark night.
The shoes bore her away over thorns and stumps till she was all torn and bleeding; she danced away over the heath to a lonely little house.
Here, she knew, lived the executioner; and she tapped with her finger at the window and said: "Come out, come out!
I cannot come in, for I must dance."
And the executioner said: "I don't suppose you know who I am.
I strike off the heads of the wicked, and I notice that my axe is tingling to do so."
"Don't cut off my head!" said Karen, "for then I could not repent of my sin.
But cut off my feet with the red shoes."
And then she confessed all her sin, and the executioner struck off her feet with the red shoes; but the shoes danced away with the little feet across the field into the deep forest.
And he carved her a pair of wooden feet and some crutches, and taught her a psalm which is always sung by sinners; she kissed the hand that guided the axe, and went away over the heath.
"Now, I have suffered enough for the red shoes," she said; "I will go to church, so that people can see me."
And she went quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back.
During the whole week she was sad and wept many bitter tears, but when Sunday came again she said: "Now I have suffered and striven enough.
I believe I am quite as good as many of those who sit in church and give themselves airs."
And so she went boldly on; but she had not got farther than the churchyard gate when she saw the red shoes dancing along before her.
Then she became terrified, and turned back and repented right heartily of her sin.
She went to the parsonage, and begged that she might be taken into service there.
She would be industrious, she said, and do everything that she could; she did not mind about the wages as long as she had a roof over her, and was with good people.
The pastor's wife had pity on her, and took her into service.
And she was industrious and thoughtful.
She sat quiet and listened when the pastor read aloud from the Bible in the evening.
All the children liked her very much, but when they spoke about dress and grandeur and beauty she would shake her head.
On the following Sunday they all went to church, and she was asked whether she wished to go too; but, with tears in her eyes, she looked sadly at her crutches.
And then the others went to hear God's Word, but she went alone into her little room; this was only large enough to hold the bed and a chair.
Here she sat down with her hymn-book, and as she was reading it with a pious mind, the wind carried the notes of the organ over to her from the church, and in tears she lifted up her face and said: "O God! help me!"
Then the sun shone so brightly, and right before her stood an angel of God in white robes; it was the same one whom she had seen that night at the church-door.
He no longer carried the sharp sword, but a beautiful green branch, full of roses; with this he touched the ceiling, which rose up very high, and where he had touched it there shone a golden star.
He touched the walls, which opened wide apart, and she saw the organ which was pealing forth; she saw the pictures of the old pastors and their wives, and the congregation sitting in the polished chairs and singing from their hymn-books.
The church itself had come to the poor girl in her narrow room, or the room had gone to the church.
She sat in the pew with the rest of the pastor's household, and when they had finished the hymn and looked up, they nodded and said, "It was right of you to come, Karen."
"It was mercy," said she.
The organ played and the children's voices in the choir sounded soft and lovely.
The bright warm sunshine streamed through the window into the pew where Karen sat, and her heart became so filled with it, so filled with peace and joy, that it broke.
Her soul flew on the sunbeams to Heaven, and no one was there who asked after the Red Shoes.
THERE was once a fine gentleman who possessed among other things a boot-jack and a hair-brush; but he had also the finest shirt-collar in the world, and of this collar we are about to hear a story.
The collar had become so old that he began to think about getting married; and one day he happened to find himself in the same washing-tub as a garter.
"Upon my word," said the shirt-collar, "I have never seen anything so slim and delicate, so neat and soft before.
May I venture to ask your name?"
"I shall not tell you," replied the garter.
"Where do you reside when you are at home?" asked the shirt-collar.
But the garter was naturally shy, and did not know how to answer such a question.
"I presume you are a girdle," said the shirt-collar, "a sort of under girdle.
I see that you are useful, as well as ornamental, my little lady."
"You must not speak to me," said the garter; "I do not think I have given you any encouragement to do so."
"Oh, when any one is as beautiful as you are," said the shirt-collar, "is not that encouragement enough?"
"Get away; don't come so near me," said the garter, "you appear to me quite like a man."
"I am a fine gentleman certainly," said the shirt-collar, "I possess a boot-jack and a hair-brush."
This was not true, for these things belonged to his master; but he was a boaster.
"Don't come so near me," said the garter; "I am not accustomed to it."
"Affectation!" said the shirt-collar.
Then they were taken out of the wash-tub, starched, and hung over a chair in the sunshine, and then laid on the ironing-board.
And now came the glowing iron.
"Mistress widow," said the shirt-collar, "little mistress widow, I feel quite warm.
I am changing, I am losing all my creases.
You are burning a hole in me.
Ugh!
I propose to you."
"You old rag," said the flat-iron, driving proudly over the collar, for she fancied herself a steam-engine, which rolls over the railway and draws carriages.
"You old rag!" said she.
The edges of the shirt-collar were a little frayed, so the scissors were brought to cut them smooth.
"Oh!" exclaimed the shirt-collar, "what a first-rate dancer you would make; you can stretch out your leg so well.
I never saw anything so charming; I am sure no human being could do the same."
"I should think not," replied the scissors.
"You ought to be a countess," said the shirt collar; "but all I possess consists of a fine gentleman, a boot-jack, and a comb.
I wish I had an estate for your sake."
"What! is he going to propose to me?" said the scissors, and she became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar, and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless.
"I shall be obliged to propose to the hair-brush," thought the shirt collar; so he remarked one day, "It is wonderful what beautiful hair you have, my little lady.
Have you never thought of being engaged?"
"You might know I should think of it," answered the hair brush; "I am engaged to the boot-jack."
"Engaged!" cried the shirt collar, "now there is no one left to propose to;" and then he pretended to despise all love-making.
A long time passed, and the shirt collar was taken in a bag to the paper-mill.
Here was a large company of rags, the fine ones lying by themselves, separated from the coarser, as it ought to be.
They had all many things to relate, especially the shirt collar, who was a terrible boaster.
"I have had an immense number of love affairs," said the shirt collar, "no one left me any peace.
It is true I was a very fine gentleman; quite stuck up.
I had a boot-jack and a brush that I never used.
You should have seen me then, when I was turned down.
I shall never forget my first love; she was a girdle, so charming, and fine, and soft, and she threw herself into a washing tub for my sake.
There was a widow too, who was warmly in love with me, but I left her alone, and she became quite black.
The next was a first-rate dancer; she gave me the wound from which I still suffer, she was so passionate.
Even my own hair-brush was in love with me, and lost all her hair through neglected love.
Yes, I have had great experience of this kind, but my greatest grief was for the garter- the girdle I meant to say- that jumped into the wash-tub.
I have a great deal on my conscience, and it is really time I should be turned into white paper."
And the shirt collar came to this at last.
All the rags were made into white paper, and the shirt collar became the very identical piece of paper which we now see, and on which this story is printed.
It happened as a punishment to him, for having boasted so shockingly of things which were not true.
And this is a warning to us, to be careful how we act, for we may some day find ourselves in the rag-bag, to be turned into white paper, on which our whole history may be written, even its most secret actions.
And it would not be pleasant to have to run about the world in the form of a piece of paper, telling everything we have done, like the boasting shirt collar.
"IT is so delightfully cold," said the Snow Man, "that it makes my whole body crackle.
This is just the kind of wind to blow life into one.
How that great red thing up there is staring at me!"
He meant the sun, who was just setting.
"It shall not make me wink.
I shall manage to keep the pieces."
He had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead of eyes; his mouth was made of an old broken rake, and was, of course, furnished with teeth.
He had been brought into existence amidst the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and the slashing of whips.
The sun went down, and the full moon rose, large, round, and clear, shining in the deep blue.
"There it comes again, from the other side," said the Snow Man, who supposed the sun was showing himself once more.
"Ah, I have cured him of staring, though; now he may hang up there, and shine, that I may see myself.
If I only knew how to manage to move away from this place,- I should so like to move.
If I could, I would slide along yonder on the ice, as I have seen the boys do; but I don't understand how; I don't even know how to run."
"Away, away," barked the old yard-dog.
He was quite hoarse, and could not pronounce "Bow wow" properly.
He had once been an indoor dog, and lay by the fire, and he had been hoarse ever since.
"The sun will make you run some day.
I saw him, last winter, make your predecessor run, and his predecessor before him.
Away, away, they all have to go."
"I don't understand you, comrade," said the Snow Man.
"Is that thing up yonder to teach me to run?
I saw it running itself a little while ago, and now it has come creeping up from the other side.
"You know nothing at all," replied the yard-dog; "but then, you've only lately been patched up.
What you see yonder is the moon, and the one before it was the sun.
It will come again to-morrow, and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well; for I think the weather is going to change.
I can feel such pricks and stabs in my left leg; I am sure there is going to be a change."
"I don't understand him," said the Snow Man to himself; "but I have a feeling that he is talking of something very disagreeable.
The one who stared so just now, and whom he calls the sun, is not my friend; I can feel that too."
"Away, away," barked the yard-dog, and then he turned round three times, and crept into his kennel to sleep.
There was really a change in the weather.
Towards morning, a thick fog covered the whole country round, and a keen wind arose, so that the cold seemed to freeze one's bones; but when the sun rose, the sight was splendid.
Trees and bushes were covered with hoar frost, and looked like a forest of white coral; while on every twig glittered frozen dew-drops.
The many delicate forms concealed in summer by luxuriant foliage, were now clearly defined, and looked like glittering lace-work.
From every twig glistened a white radiance.
The birch, waving in the wind, looked full of life, like trees in summer; and its appearance was wondrously beautiful.
And where the sun shone, how everything glittered and sparkled, as if diamond dust had been strewn about; while the snowy carpet of the earth appeared as if covered with diamonds, from which countless lights gleamed, whiter than even the snow itself.
"This is really beautiful," said a young girl, who had come into the garden with a young man; and they both stood still near the Snow Man, and contemplated the glittering scene.
"Summer cannot show a more beautiful sight," she exclaimed, while her eyes sparkled.
"And we can't have such a fellow as this in the summer time," replied the young man, pointing to the Snow Man; "he is capital."
The girl laughed, and nodded at the Snow Man, and then tripped away over the snow with her friend.
The snow creaked and crackled beneath her feet, as if she had been treading on starch.
"Who are these two?" asked the Snow Man of the yard-dog.
"You have been here longer than I have; do you know them?"
"Of course I know them," replied the yard-dog; "she has stroked my back many times, and he has given me a bone of meat.
I never bite those two."
"But what are they?" asked the Snow Man.
"They are lovers," he replied; "they will go and live in the same kennel by-and-by, and gnaw at the same bone.
Away, away!"
"Are they the same kind of beings as you and I?" asked the Snow Man.
"Well, they belong to the same master," retorted the yard-dog.
"Certainly people who were only born yesterday know very little.
I can see that in you.
I have age and experience.
I know every one here in the house, and I know there was once a time when I did not lie out here in the cold, fastened to a chain.
Away, away!"
"The cold is delightful," said the Snow Man; "but do tell me tell me; only you must not clank your chain so; for it jars all through me when you do that."
"Away, away!" barked the yard-dog; "I'll tell you; they said I was a pretty little fellow once; then I used to lie in a velvet-covered chair, up at the master's house, and sit in the mistress's lap.
They used to kiss my nose, and wipe my paws with an embroidered handkerchief, and I was called 'Ami, dear Ami, sweet Ami.'
But after a while I grew too big for them, and they sent me away to the housekeeper's room; so I came to live on the lower story.
You can look into the room from where you stand, and see where I was master once; for I was indeed master to the housekeeper.
It was certainly a smaller room than those up stairs; but I was more comfortable; for I was not being continually taken hold of and pulled about by the children as I had been.
I received quite as good food, or even better.
I had my own cushion, and there was a stove- it is the finest thing in the world at this season of the year.
I used to go under the stove, and lie down quite beneath it.
Ah, I still dream of that stove.
Away, away!"
"Does a stove look beautiful?" asked the Snow Man, "is it at all like me?"
"It is just the reverse of you,' said the dog; "it's as black as a crow, and has a long neck and a brass knob; it eats firewood, so that fire spurts out of its mouth.
We should keep on one side, or under it, to be comfortable.
You can see it through the window, from where you stand."
Then the Snow Man looked, and saw a bright polished thing with a brazen knob, and fire gleaming from the lower part of it.
The Snow Man felt quite a strange sensation come over him; it was very odd, he knew not what it meant, and he could not account for it.
But there are people who are not men of snow, who understand what it is.
"'And why did you leave her?" asked the Snow Man, for it seemed to him that the stove must be of the female sex.
"How could you give up such a comfortable place?"
"I was obliged," replied the yard-dog.
"They turned me out of doors, and chained me up here.
I had bitten the youngest of my master's sons in the leg, because he kicked away the bone I was gnawing.
'Bone for bone,' I thought; but they were so angry, and from that time I have been fastened with a chain, and lost my bone.
Don't you hear how hoarse I am.
Away, away!
I can't talk any more like other dogs.
Away, away, that is the end of it all."
But the Snow Man was no longer listening.
He was looking into the housekeeper's room on the lower storey; where the stove stood on its four iron legs, looking about the same size as the Snow Man himself.
"What a strange crackling I feel within me," he said.
"Shall I ever get in there?
It is an innocent wish, and innocent wishes are sure to be fulfilled.
I must go in there and lean against her, even if I have to break the window."
"You must never go in there," said the yard-dog, "for if you approach the stove, you'll melt away, away."
"I might as well go," said the Snow Man, "for I think I am breaking up as it is."
During the whole day the Snow Man stood looking in through the window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun or the moon; no, only the bright light which gleams from a stove when it has been well fed.
When the door of the stove was opened, the flames darted out of its mouth; this is customary with all stoves.
The light of the flames fell directly on the face and breast of the Snow Man with a ruddy gleam.
"I can endure it no longer," said he; "how beautiful it looks when it stretches out its tongue?"
The night was long, but did not appear so to the Snow Man, who stood there enjoying his own reflections, and crackling with the cold.
In the morning, the window-panes of the housekeeper's room were covered with ice.
They were the most beautiful ice-flowers any Snow Man could desire, but they concealed the stove.
These window-panes would not thaw, and he could see nothing of the stove, which he pictured to himself, as if it had been a lovely human being.
The snow crackled and the wind whistled around him; it was just the kind of frosty weather a Snow Man might thoroughly enjoy.
But he did not enjoy it; how, indeed, could he enjoy anything when he was "stove sick?"
"That is terrible disease for a Snow Man," said the yard-dog; "I have suffered from it myself, but I got over it.
Away, away," he barked and then he added, "the weather is going to change."
And the weather did change; it began to thaw.
As the warmth increased, the Snow Man decreased.
He said nothing and made no complaint, which is a sure sign.
One morning he broke, and sunk down altogether; and, behold, where he had stood, something like a broomstick remained sticking up in the ground.
It was the pole round which the boys had built him up.
"Ah, now I understand why he had such a great longing for the stove," said the yard-dog.
"Why, there's the shovel that is used for cleaning out the stove, fastened to the pole."
The Snow Man had a stove scraper in his body; that was what moved him so.
"But it's all over now.
Away, away."
And soon the winter passed.
"Away, away," barked the hoarse yard-dog.
But the girls in the house sang,
"Come from your fragrant home, green thyme; Stretch your soft branches, willow-tree; The months are bringing the sweet spring-time, When the lark in the sky sings joyfully.
Come gentle sun, while the cuckoo sings, And I'll mock his note in my wanderings."
And nobody thought any more of the Snow Man.
"I MEAN to be somebody, and do something useful in the world," said the eldest of five brothers.
"I don't care how humble my position is, so that I can only do some good, which will be something.
I intend to be a brickmaker; bricks are always wanted, and I shall be really doing something."
"Your 'something' is not enough for me," said the second brother; "what you talk of doing is nothing at all, it is journeyman's work, or might even be done by a machine.
No!
I should prefer to be a builder at once, there is something real in that.
A man gains a position, he becomes a citizen, has his own sign, his own house of call for his workmen: so I shall be a builder.
If all goes well, in time I shall become a master, and have my own journeymen, and my wife will be treated as a master's wife.
This is what I call something."
"I call it all nothing," said the third; "not in reality any position.
There are many in a town far above a master builder in position.
You may be an upright man, but even as a master you will only be ranked among common men.
I know better what to do than that.
I will be an architect, which will place me among those who possess riches and intellect, and who speculate in art.
I shall certainly have to rise by my own endeavors from a bricklayer's laborer, or as a carpenter's apprentice- a lad wearing a paper cap, although I now wear a silk hat.
I shall have to fetch beer and spirits for the journeymen, and they will call me 'thou,' which will be an insult.
I shall endure it, however, for I shall look upon it all as a mere representation, a masquerade, a mummery, which to-morrow, that is, when I myself as a journeyman, shall have served my time, will vanish, and I shall go my way, and all that has passed will be nothing to me.
Then I shall enter the academy, and get instructed in drawing, and be called an architect.
I may even attain to rank, and have something placed before or after my name, and I shall build as others have done before me.
By this there will be always 'something' to make me remembered, and is not that worth living for?"
"Not in my opinion," said the fourth; "I will never follow the lead of others, and only imitate what they have done.
I will be a genius, and become greater than all of you together.
I will create a new style of building, and introduce a plan for erecting houses suitable to the climate, with material easily obtained in the country, and thus suit national feeling and the developments of the age, besides building a storey for my own genius."
"But supposing the climate and the material are not good for much," said the fifth brother, "that would be very unfortunate for you, and have an influence over your experiments.
Nationality may assert itself until it becomes affectation, and the developments of a century may run wild, as youth often does.
I see clearly that none of you will ever really be anything worth notice, however you may now fancy it.
But do as you like, I shall not imitate you.
I mean to keep clear of all these things, and criticize what you do.
In every action something imperfect may be discovered, something not right, which I shall make it my business to find out and expose; that will be something, I fancy."
And he kept his word, and became a critic.
People said of this fifth brother, "There is something very precise about him; he has a good head-piece, but he does nothing."
And on that very account they thought he must be something.
Now, you see, this is a little history which will never end; as long as the world exists, there will always be men like these five brothers.
And what became of them?
Were they each nothing or something?
You shall hear; it is quite a history.
The eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants.
So you see the value of bricks.
Some of the bricks, however, crumbled to pieces, or were broken, but the elder brother found a use for even these.
On the high bank of earth, which formed a dyke on the sea-coast, a poor woman named Margaret wished to build herself a house, so all the imperfect bricks were given to her, and a few whole ones with them; for the eldest brother was a kind-hearted man, although he never achieved anything higher than making bricks.
The poor woman built herself a little house- it was small and narrow, and the window was quite crooked, the door too low, and the straw roof might have been better thatched.
But still it was a shelter, and from within you could look far over the sea, which dashed wildly against the sea-wall on which the little house was built.
The salt waves sprinkled their white foam over it, but it stood firm, and remained long after he who had given the bricks to build it was dead and buried.
The second brother of course knew better how to build than poor Margaret, for he served an apprenticeship to learn it.
When his time was up, he packed up his knapsack, and went on his travels, singing the journeyman's song,-
"While young, I can wander without a care, And build new houses everywhere; Fair and bright are my dreams of home, Always thought of wherever I roam.
Hurrah for a workman's life of glee!
There's a loved one at home who thinks of me; Home and friends I can ne'er forget, And I mean to be a master yet."
And that is what he did.
On his return home, he became a master builder,- built one house after another in the town, till they formed quite a street, which, when finished, became really an ornament to the town.
These houses built a house for him in return, which was to be his own.
But how can houses build a house?
If the houses were asked, they could not answer; but the people would understand, and say, "Certainly the street built his house for him."
It was not very large, and the floor was of lime; but when he danced with his bride on the lime-covered floor, it was to him white and shining, and from every stone in the wall flowers seemed to spring forth and decorate the room as with the richest tapestry.
It was really a pretty house, and in it were a happy pair.
The flag of the corporation fluttered before it, and the journeymen and apprentices shouted "Hurrah."
He had gained his position, he had made himself something, and at last he died, which was "something" too.
Now we come to the architect, the third brother, who had been first a carpenter's apprentice, had worn a cap, and served as an errand boy, but afterwards went to the academy, and risen to be an architect, a high and noble gentleman.
Ah yes, the houses of the new street, which the brother who was a master builder erected, may have built his house for him, but the street received its name from the architect, and the handsomest house in the street became his property.
That was something, and he was "something," for he had a list of titles before and after his name.
His children were called "wellborn," and when he died, his widow was treated as a lady of position, and that was "something."
His name remained always written at the corner of the street, and lived in every one's mouth as its name.
Yes, this also was something."
And what about the genius of the family- the fourth brother- who wanted to invent something new and original?
He tried to build a lofty storey himself, but it fell to pieces, and he fell with it and broke his neck.
However, he had a splendid funeral, with the city flags and music in the procession; flowers were strewn on the pavement, and three orations were spoken over his grave, each one longer than the other.
He would have liked this very much during his life, as well as the poems about him in the papers, for he liked nothing so well as to be talked of.
A monument was also erected over his grave.
It was only another storey over him, but that was "something," Now he was dead, like the three other brothers.
The youngest- the critic- outlived them all, which was quite right for him.
It gave him the opportunity of having the last word, which to him was of great importance.
People always said he had a good head-piece.
At last his hour came, and he died, and arrived at the gates of heaven.
Souls always enter these gates in pairs; so he found himself standing and waiting for admission with another; and who should it be but old dame Margaret, from the house on the dyke!
"It is evidently for the sake of contrast that I and this wretched soul should arrive here exactly at the same time," said the critic.
"Pray who are you, my good woman?" said he; "do you want to get in here too?"
And the old woman curtsied as well as she could; she thought it must be St. Peter himself who spoke to her.
"I am a poor old woman," she said, "without my family.
I am old Margaret, that lived in the house on the dyke."
"Well, and what have you done- what great deed have you performed down below?"
"I have done nothing at all in the world that could give me a claim to have these doors open for me," she said.
"It would be only through mercy that I can be allowed to slip in through the gate."
"In what manner did you leave the world?" he asked, just for the sake of saying something; for it made him feel very weary to stand there and wait.
"How I left the world?" she replied; "why, I can scarcely tell you.
During the last years of my life I was sick and miserable, and I was unable to bear creeping out of bed suddenly into the frost and cold.
Last winter was a hard winter, but I have got over it all now.
There were a few mild days, as your honor, no doubt, knows.
The ice lay thickly on the lake, as far one could see.
The people came from the town, and walked upon it, and they say there were dancing and skating upon it, I believe, and a great feasting.
The sound of beautiful music came into my poor little room where I lay.
Towards evening, when the moon rose beautifully, though not yet in her full splendor, I glanced from my bed over the wide sea; and there, just where the sea and sky met, rose a curious white cloud.
I lay looking at the cloud till I observed a little black spot in the middle of it, which gradually grew larger and larger, and then I knew what it meant- I am old and experienced; and although this token is not often seen, I knew it, and a shuddering seized me.
Twice in my life had I seen this same thing, and I knew that there would be an awful storm, with a spring tide, which would overwhelm the poor people who were now out on the ice, drinking, dancing, and making merry.
Young and old, the whole city, were there; who was to warn them, if no one noticed the sign, or knew what it meant as I did?
I was so alarmed, that I felt more strength and life than I had done for some time.
I got out of bed, and reached the window; I could not crawl any farther from weakness and exhaustion; but I managed to open the window.
I saw the people outside running and jumping about on the ice; I saw the beautiful flags waving in the wind; I heard the boys shouting, 'Hurrah!' and the lads and lasses singing, and everything full of merriment and joy.
But there was the white cloud with the black spot hanging over them.
I cried out as loudly as I could, but no one heard me; I was too far off from the people.
Soon would the storm burst, the ice break, and all who were on it be irretrievably lost.
They could not hear me, and to go to them was quite out of my power.
Oh, if I could only get them safe on land!
Then came the thought, as if from heaven, that I would rather set fire to my bed, and let the house be burnt down, than that so many people should perish miserably.
I got a light, and in a few moments the red flames leaped up as a beacon to them.
I escaped fortunately as far as the threshold of the door; but there I fell down and remained: I could go no farther.
The flames rushed out towards me, flickered on the window, and rose high above the roof.
The people on the ice became aware of the fire, and ran as fast as possible to help a poor sick woman, who, as they thought, was being burnt to death.
There was not one who did not run.
I heard them coming, and I also at the same time was conscious of a rush of air and a sound like the roar of heavy artillery.
The spring flood was lifting the ice covering, which brake into a thousand pieces.
But the people had reached the sea-wall, where the sparks were flying round.
I had saved them all; but I suppose I could not survive the cold and fright; so I came up here to the gates of paradise.
I am told they are open to poor creatures such as I am, and I have now no house left on earth; but I do not think that will give me a claim to be admitted here."
Then the gates were opened, and an angel led the old woman in.
She had dropped one little straw out of her straw bed, when she set it on fire to save the lives of so many.
It had been changed into the purest gold- into gold that constantly grew and expanded into flowers and fruit of immortal beauty.
"See," said the angel, pointing to the wonderful straw, "this is what the poor woman has brought.
What dost thou bring?
I know thou hast accomplished nothing, not even made a single brick.
Even if thou couldst return, and at least produce so much, very likely, when made, the brick would be useless, unless done with a good will, which is always something.
But thou canst not return to earth, and I can do nothing for thee."
Then the poor soul, the old mother who had lived in the house on the dyke, pleaded for him.
She said, "His brother made all the stone and bricks, and sent them to me to build my poor little dwelling, which was a great deal to do for a poor woman like me.
Could not all these bricks and pieces be as a wall of stone to prevail for him?
It is an act of mercy; he is wanting it now; and here is the very fountain of mercy."
"Then," said the angel, "thy brother, he who has been looked upon as the meanest of you all, he whose honest deeds to thee appeared so humble,- it is he who has sent you this heavenly gift.
Thou shalt not be turned away.
Thou shalt have permission to stand without the gate and reflect, and repent of thy life on earth; but thou shalt not be admitted here until thou hast performed one good deed of repentance, which will indeed for thee be something."
"I could have expressed that better," thought the critic; but he did not say it aloud, which for him was SOMETHING, after all.
ON the last house in a little village the storks had built a nest, and the mother stork sat in it with her four young ones, who stretched out their necks and pointed their black beaks, which had not yet turned red like those of the parent birds.
A little way off, on the edge of the roof, stood the father stork, quite upright and stiff; not liking to be quite idle, he drew up one leg, and stood on the other, so still that it seemed almost as if he were carved in wood.
"It must look very grand," thought he, "for my wife to have a sentry guarding her nest.
They do not know that I am her husband; they will think I have been commanded to stand here, which is quite aristocratic;" and so he continued standing on one leg.
In the street below were a number of children at play, and when they caught sight of the storks, one of the boldest amongst the boys began to sing a song about them, and very soon he was joined by the rest.
These are the words of the song, but each only sang what he could remember of them in his own way.
"Stork, stork, fly away, Stand not on one leg, I pray, See your wife is in her nest, With her little ones at rest.
They will hang one, And fry another; They will shoot a third, And roast his brother."
"Just hear what those boys are singing," said the young storks; "they say we shall be hanged and roasted."
"Never mind what they say; you need not listen," said the mother.
"They can do no harm."
But the boys went on singing and pointing at the storks, and mocking at them, excepting one of the boys whose name was Peter; he said it was a shame to make fun of animals, and would not join with them at all.
The mother stork comforted her young ones, and told them not to mind.
"See," she said, "How quiet your father stands, although he is only on one leg."
"But we are very much frightened," said the young storks, and they drew back their heads into the nests.
The next day when the children were playing together, and saw the storks, they sang the song again-
"They will hang one, And roast another."
"Shall we be hanged and roasted?" asked the young storks.
"No, certainly not," said the mother.
"I will teach you to fly, and when you have learnt, we will fly into the meadows, and pay a visit to the frogs, who will bow themselves to us in the water, and cry 'Croak, croak,' and then we shall eat them up; that will be fun."
"And what next?" asked the young storks.
"Then," replied the mother, "all the storks in the country will assemble together, and go through their autumn manoeuvres, so that it is very important for every one to know how to fly properly.
If they do not, the general will thrust them through with his beak, and kill them.
Therefore you must take pains and learn, so as to be ready when the drilling begins."
"Then we may be killed after all, as the boys say; and hark! they are singing again."
"Listen to me, and not to them," said the mother stork.
"After the great review is over, we shall fly away to warm countries far from hence, where there are mountains and forests.
To Egypt, where we shall see three-cornered houses built of stone, with pointed tops that reach nearly to the clouds.
They are called Pyramids, and are older than a stork could imagine; and in that country, there is a river that overflows its banks, and then goes back, leaving nothing but mire; there we can walk about, and eat frogs in abundance."
"Oh, o- h!" cried the young storks.
"Yes, it is a delightful place; there is nothing to do all day long but eat, and while we are so well off out there, in this country there will not be a single green leaf on the trees, and the weather will be so cold that the clouds will freeze, and fall on the earth in little white rags."
The stork meant snow, but she could not explain it in any other way.
"Will the naughty boys freeze and fall in pieces?" asked the young storks.
"No, they will not freeze and fall into pieces," said the mother, "but they will be very cold, and be obliged to sit all day in a dark, gloomy room, while we shall be flying about in foreign lands, where there are blooming flowers and warm sunshine."
Time passed on, and the young storks grew so large that they could stand upright in the nest and look about them.
The father brought them, every day, beautiful frogs, little snakes, and all kinds of stork-dainties that he could find.
And then, how funny it was to see the tricks he would perform to amuse them.
He would lay his head quite round over his tail, and clatter with his beak, as if it had been a rattle; and then he would tell them stories all about the marshes and fens.
"Come," said the mother one day, "Now you must learn to fly."
And all the four young ones were obliged to come out on the top of the roof.
Oh, how they tottered at first, and were obliged to balance themselves with their wings, or they would have fallen to the ground below.
"Look at me," said the mother, "you must hold your heads in this way, and place your feet so.
Once, twice, once, twice- that is it.
Now you will be able to take care of yourselves in the world."
Then she flew a little distance from them, and the young ones made a spring to follow her; but down they fell plump, for their bodies were still too heavy.
"I don't want to fly," said one of the young storks, creeping back into the nest.
"I don't care about going to warm countries."
"Would you like to stay here and freeze when the winter comes?" said the mother, "or till the boys comes to hang you, or to roast you?- Well then, I'll call them."
"Oh no, no," said the young stork, jumping out on the roof with the others; and now they were all attentive, and by the third day could fly a little.
Then they began to fancy they could soar, so they tried to do so, resting on their wings, but they soon found themselves falling, and had to flap their wings as quickly as possible.
The boys came again in the street singing their song:-
"Stork, stork, fly away."
"Shall we fly down, and pick their eyes out?" asked the young storks.
"No; leave them alone," said the mother.
"Listen to me; that is much more important.
Now then.
One-two-three.
Now to the right.
One-two-three.
Now to the left, round the chimney.
There now, that was very good.
That last flap of the wings was so easy and graceful, that I shall give you permission to fly with me to-morrow to the marshes.
There will be a number of very superior storks there with their families, and I expect you to show them that my children are the best brought up of any who may be present.
You must strut about proudly- it will look well and make you respected."
"But may we not punish those naughty boys?" asked the young storks.
"No; let them scream away as much as they like.
You can fly from them now up high amid the clouds, and will be in the land of the pyramids when they are freezing, and have not a green leaf on the trees or an apple to eat."
"We will revenge ourselves," whispered the young storks to each other, as they again joined the exercising.
Of all the boys in the street who sang the mocking song about the storks, not one was so determined to go on with it as he who first began it.
Yet he was a little fellow not more than six years old.
To the young storks he appeared at least a hundred, for he was so much bigger than their father and mother.
To be sure, storks cannot be expected to know how old children and grown-up people are.
So they determined to have their revenge on this boy, because he began the song first and would keep on with it.
The young storks were very angry, and grew worse as they grew older; so at last their mother was obliged to promise that they should be revenged, but not until the day of their departure.
"We must see first, how you acquit yourselves at the grand review," said she.
"If you get on badly there, the general will thrust his beak through you, and you will be killed, as the boys said, though not exactly in the same manner.
So we must wait and see."
"You shall see," said the young birds, and then they took such pains and practised so well every day, that at last it was quite a pleasure to see them fly so lightly and prettily.
As soon as the autumn arrived, all the storks began to assemble together before taking their departure for warm countries during the winter.
Then the review commenced.
They flew over forests and villages to show what they could do, for they had a long journey before them.
The young storks performed their part so well that they received a mark of honor, with frogs and snakes as a present.
These presents were the best part of the affair, for they could eat the frogs and snakes, which they very quickly did.
"Now let us have our revenge," they cried.
"Yes, certainly," cried the mother stork.
"I have thought upon the best way to be revenged.
I know the pond in which all the little children lie, waiting till the storks come to take them to their parents.
The prettiest little babies lie there dreaming more sweetly than they will ever dream in the time to come.
All parents are glad to have a little child, and children are so pleased with a little brother or sister.
Now we will fly to the pond and fetch a little baby for each of the children who did not sing that naughty song to make game of the storks."
"But the naughty boy, who began the song first, what shall we do to him?" cried the young storks.
"There lies in the pond a little dead baby who has dreamed itself to death," said the mother.
"We will take it to the naughty boy, and he will cry because we have brought him a little dead brother.
But you have not forgotten the good boy who said it was a shame to laugh at animals: we will take him a little brother and sister too, because he was good.
He is called Peter, and you shall all be called Peter in future."
So they all did what their mother had arranged, and from that day, even till now, all the storks have been called Peter.
IN the old days, when grandpapa was quite a little boy, and ran about in little red breeches and a red coat, and a feather in his cap- for that's the costume the little boys wore in his time when they were dressed in their best- many things were very different from what they are now.
There was often a good deal of show in the streets- show that we don't see nowadays, because it has been abolished as too old-fashioned.
Still, it is very interesting to hear grandfather tell about it.
It must really have been a gorgeous sight to behold, in those days, when the shoemaker brought over the shield, when the court-house was changed.
The silken flag waved to and fro, on the shield itself a double eagle was displayed, and a big boot; the youngest lads carried the "welcome," and the chest of the workmen's guild, and their shirt-sleeves were adorned with red and white ribbons; the elder ones carried drawn swords, each with a lemon stuck on its point.
There was a full band of music, and the most splendid of all the instruments was the "bird," as grandfather called the big stick with the crescent on the top, and all manner of dingle-dangles hanging to it- a perfect Turkish clatter of music.
The stick was lifted high in the air, and swung up and down till it jingled again, and quite dazzled one's eyes when the sun shone on all its glory of gold, and silver, and brass.
In front of the procession ran the Harlequin, dressed in clothes made of all kinds of colored patches artfully sewn together, with a black face, and bells on his head like a sledge horse.
He beat the people with his bat, which made a great clattering without hurting them, and the people would crowd together and fall back, only to advance again the next moment.
Little boys and girls fell over their own toes into the gutter, old women dispensed digs with their elbows, and looked sour, and took snuff.
One laughed, another chatted; the people thronged the windows and door-steps, and even all the roofs.
The sun shone; and although they had a little rain too, that was good for the farmer; and when they got wetted thoroughly, they only thought what a blessing it was for the country.
And what stories grandpapa could tell!
As a little boy he had seen all these fine doings in their greatest pomp.
The oldest of the policemen used to make a speech from the platform on which the shield was hung up, and the speech was in verse, as if it had been made by a poet, as, indeed it had; for three people had concocted it together, and they had first drunk a good bowl of punch, so that the speech might turn out well.
And the people gave a cheer for the speech, but they shouted much louder for the Harlequin, when he appeared in front of the platform, and made a grimace at them.
The fools played the fool most admirably, and drank mead out of spirit-glasses, which they then flung among the crowd, by whom they were caught up.
Grandfather was the possessor of one of these glasses, which had been given him by a working mason, who had managed to catch it.
Such a scene was really very pleasant; and the shield on the new court-house was hung with flowers and green wreaths.
"One never forgets a feast like that, however old one may grow," said grandfather.
Nor did he forget it, though he saw many other grand spectacles in his time, and could tell about them too; but it was most pleasant of all to hear him tell about the shield that was brought in the town from the old to the new court-house.
Once, when he was a little boy, grandpapa had gone with his parents to see this festivity.
He had never yet been in the metropolis of the country.
There were so many people in the streets, that he thought that the shield was being carried.
There were many shields to be seen; a hundred rooms might have been filled with pictures, if they had been hung up inside and outside.
At the tailor's were pictures of all kinds of clothing, to show that he could stitch up people from the coarsest to the finest; at the tobacco manufacturer's were pictures of the most charming little boys, smoking cigars, just as they do in reality; there were signs with painted butter, and herring, clerical collars, and coffins, and inscriptions and announcements into the bargain.
A person could walk up and down for a whole day through the streets, and tire himself out with looking at the pictures; and then he would know all about what people lived in the houses, for they had hung out their shields or signs; and, as grandfather said, it was a very instructive thing, in a great town, to know at once who the inhabitants were.
And this is what happened with these shields, when grandpapa came to the town.
He told it me himself, and he hadn't "a rogue on his back," as mother used to tell me he had when he wanted to make me believe something outrageous, for now he looked quite trustworthy.
The first night after he came to the town had been signalized by the most terrible gale ever recorded in the newspapers- a gale such as none of the inhabitants had ever before experienced.
The air was dark with flying tiles; old wood-work crashed and fell; and a wheelbarrow ran up the streets all alone, only to get out of the way.
There was a groaning in the air, and a howling and a shrieking, and altogether it was a terrible storm.
The water in the canal rose over the banks, for it did not know where to run.
The storm swept over the town, carrying plenty of chimneys with it, and more than one proud weathercock on a church tower had to bow, and has never got over it from that time.
There was a kind of sentry-house, where dwelt the venerable old superintendent of the fire brigade, who always arrived with the last engine.
The storm would not leave this little sentry-house alone, but must needs tear it from its fastenings, and roll it down the street; and, wonderfully enough, it stopped opposite to the door of the dirty journeyman plasterer, who had saved three lives at the last fire, but the sentry-house thought nothing of that.
The barber's shield, the great brazen dish, was carried away, and hurled straight into the embrasure of the councillor of justice; and the whole neighborhood said this looked almost like malice, inasmuch as they, and nearly all the friends of the councillor's wife, used to call that lady "the Razor" for she was so sharp that she knew more about other people's business than they knew about it themselves.
A shield with a dried salt fish painted on it flew exactly in front of the door of a house where dwelt a man who wrote a newspaper.
That was a very poor joke perpetrated by the gale, which seemed to have forgotten that a man who writes in a paper is not the kind of person to understand any liberty taken with him; for he is a king in his own newspaper, and likewise in his own opinion.
The weathercock flew to the opposite house, where he perched, looking the picture of malice- so the neighbors said.
The cooper's tub stuck itself up under the head of "ladies' costumes."
The eating-house keeper's bill of fare, which had hung at his door in a heavy frame, was posted by the storm over the entrance to the theatre, where nobody went.
"It was a ridiculous list- horse-radish, soup, and stuffed cabbage."
And now people came in plenty.
The fox's skin, the honorable sign of the furrier, was found fastened to the bell-pull of a young man who always went to early lecture, and looked like a furled umbrella.
He said he was striving after truth, and was considered by his aunt "a model and an example."
The inscription "Institution for Superior Education" was found near the billiard club, which place of resort was further adorned with the words, "Children brought up by hand."
Now, this was not at all witty; but, you see, the storm had done it, and no one has any control over that.
It was a terrible night, and in the morning- only think!- nearly all the shields had changed places.
In some places the inscriptions were so malicious, that grandfather would not speak of them at all; but I saw that he was chuckling secretly, and there may have been some inaccuracy in his description, after all.
The poor people in the town, and still more the strangers, were continually making mistakes in the people they wanted to see; nor was this to be avoided, when they went according to the shields that were hung up.
Thus, for instance, some who wanted to go to a very grave assembly of elderly men, where important affairs were to be discussed, found themselves in a noisy boys' school, where all the company were leaping over the chairs and tables.
There were also people who made a mistake between the church and the theatre, and that was terrible indeed!
Such a storm we have never witnessed in our day; for that only happened in grandpapa's time, when he was quite a little boy.
Perhaps we shall never experience a storm of the kind, but our grandchildren may; and we can only hope and pray that all may stay at home while the storm is moving the shields.
ONCE upon a time lived a poor prince; his kingdom was very small, but it was large enough to enable him to marry, and marry he would.
It was rather bold of him that he went and asked the emperor's daughter: "Will you marry me?" but he ventured to do so, for his name was known far and wide, and there were hundreds of princesses who would have gladly accepted him, but would she do so?
Now we shall see.
On the grave of the prince's father grew a rose-tree, the most beautiful of its kind.
It bloomed only once in five years, and then it had only one single rose upon it, but what a rose!
It had such a sweet scent that one instantly forgot all sorrow and grief when one smelt it.
He had also a nightingale, which could sing as if every sweet melody was in its throat.
This rose and the nightingale he wished to give to the princess; and therefore both were put into big silver cases and sent to her.
The emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall where the princess was just playing "Visitors are coming" with her ladies-in-waiting; when she saw the large cases with the presents therein, she clapped her hands for joy.
"I wish it were a little pussy cat," she said.
But then the rose-tree with the beautiful rose was unpacked.
"Oh, how nicely it is made," exclaimed the ladies.
"It is more than nice," said the emperor, "it is charming."
The princess touched it and nearly began to cry.
"For shame, pa," she said, "it is not artificial, it is natural!"
"For shame, it is natural" repeated all her ladies.
"Let us first see what the other case contains before we are angry," said the emperor; then the nightingale was taken out, and it sang so beautifully that no one could possibly say anything unkind about it.
"Superbe, charmant," said the ladies of the court, for they all prattled French, one worse than the other.
"How much the bird reminds me of the musical box of the late lamented empress," said an old courtier, "it has exactly the same tone, the same execution."
"You are right," said the emperor, and began to cry like a little child.
"I hope it is not natural," said the princess.
"Yes, certainly it is natural," replied those who had brought the presents.
"Then let it fly," said the princess, and refused to see the prince.
But the prince was not discouraged.
He painted his face, put on common clothes, pulled his cap over his forehead, and came back.
"Good day, emperor," he said, "could you not give me some employment at the court?"
"There are so many," replied the emperor, "who apply for places, that for the present I have no vacancy, but I will remember you.
But wait a moment; it just comes into my mind, I require somebody to look after my pigs, for I have a great many."
Thus the prince was appointed imperial swineherd, and as such he lived in a wretchedly small room near the pigsty; there he worked all day long, and when it was night he had made a pretty little pot.
There were little bells round the rim, and when the water began to boil in it, the bells began to play the old tune:
"A jolly old sow once lived in a sty, Three little piggies had she," &c.
But what was more wonderful was that, when one put a finger into the steam rising from the pot, one could at once smell what meals they were preparing on every fire in the whole town.
That was indeed much more remarkable than the rose.
When the princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune, she stopped and looked quite pleased, for she also could play it- in fact, it was the only tune she could play, and she played it with one finger.
"That is the tune I know," she exclaimed.
"He must be a well-educated swineherd.
Go and ask him how much the instrument is."
One of the ladies had to go and ask; but she put on pattens.
"What will you take for your pot?" asked the lady.
"I will have ten kisses from the princess," said the swineherd.
"God forbid," said the lady.
"Well, I cannot sell it for less," replied the swineherd.
"What did he say?" said the princess.
I really cannot tell you," replied the lady.
"You can whisper it into my ear."
"It is very naughty," said the princess, and walked off.
But when she had gone a little distance, the bells rang again so sweetly:
"A jolly old sow once lived in a sty, Three little piggies had she," &c.
"Ask him," said the princess, "if he will be satisfied with ten kisses from one of my ladies."
"No, thank you," said the swineherd: "ten kisses from the princess, or I keep my pot."
"That is tiresome," said the princess.
"But you must stand before me, so that nobody can see it."
The ladies placed themselves in front of her and spread out their dresses, and she gave the swineherd ten kisses and received the pot.
That was a pleasure!
Day and night the water in the pot was boiling; there was not a single fire in the whole town of which they did not know what was preparing on it, the chamberlain's as well as the shoemaker's.
The ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy.
"We know who will eat soup and pancakes; we know who will eat porridge and cutlets; oh, how interesting!"
"Very interesting, indeed," said the mistress of the household.
"But you must not betray me, for I am the emperor's daughter."
"Of course not," they all said.
The swineherd- that is to say, the prince- but they did not know otherwise than that he was a real swineherd- did not waste a single day without doing something; he made a rattle, which, when turned quickly round, played all the waltzes, galops, and polkas known since the creation of the world.
"But that is superbe," said the princess passing by.
"I have never heard a more beautiful composition.
Go down and ask him what the instrument costs; but I shall not kiss him again."
"He will have a hundred kisses from the princess," said the lady, who had gone down to ask him.
"I believe he is mad," said the princess, and walked off, but soon she stopped.
"One must encourage art," she said.
"I am the emperor's daughter!
Tell him I will give him ten kisses, as I did the other day; the remainder one of my ladies can give him.
"But we do not like to kiss him" said the ladies.
"That is nonsense," said the princess; "if I can kiss him, you can also do it.
Remember that I give you food and employment."
And the lady had to go down once more.
"A hundred kisses from the princess," said the swineherd, "or everybody keeps his own."
"Place yourselves before me," said the princess then.
They did as they were bidden, and the princess kissed him.
"I wonder what that crowd near the pigsty means!" said the emperor, who had just come out on his balcony.
He rubbed his eyes and put his spectacles on.
"The ladies of the court are up to some mischief, I think.
I shall have to go down and see."
He pulled up his shoes, for they were down at the heels, and he was very quick about it.
When he had come down into the courtyard he walked quite softly, and the ladies were so busily engaged in counting the kisses, that all should be fair, that they did not notice the emperor.
He raised himself on tiptoe.
"What does this mean?" he said, when he saw that his daughter was kissing the swineherd, and then hit their heads with his shoe just as the swineherd received the sixty-eighth kiss.
"Go out of my sight," said the emperor, for he was very angry; and both the princess and the swineherd were banished from the empire.
There she stood and cried, the swineherd scolded her, and the rain came down in torrents.
"Alas, unfortunate creature that I am!" said the princess, "I wish I had accepted the prince.
Oh, how wretched I am!"
The swineherd went behind a tree, wiped his face, threw off his poor attire and stepped forth in his princely garments; he looked so beautiful that the princess could not help bowing to him.
"I have now learnt to despise you," he said.
"You refused an honest prince; you did not appreciate the rose and the nightingale; but you did not mind kissing a swineherd for his toys; you have no one but yourself to blame!"
And then he returned into his kingdom and left her behind.
She could now sing at her leisure:
"A jolly old sow once lived in a sty, Three little piggies has she," &c.
THE well was deep, and therefore the rope had to be a long one; it was heavy work turning the handle when any one had to raise a bucketful of water over the edge of the well.
Though the water was clear, the sun never looked down far enough into the well to mirror itself in the waters; but as far as its beams could reach, green things grew forth between the stones in the sides of the well.
Down below dwelt a family of the Toad race.
They had, in fact, come head-over-heels down the well, in the person of the old Mother-Toad, who was still alive.
The green Frogs, who had been established there a long time, and swam about in the water, called them "well-guests."
But the new-comers seemed determined to stay where they were, for they found it very agreeable living "in a dry place," as they called the wet stones.
The Mother-Frog had once been a traveller.
She happened to be in the water-bucket when it was drawn up, but the light became too strong for her, and she got a pain in her eyes.
Fortunately she scrambled out of the bucket; but she fell into the water with a terrible flop, and had to lie sick for three days with pains in her back.
She certainly had not much to tell of the things up above, but she knew this, and all the Frogs knew it, that the well was not all the world.
The Mother-Toad might have told this and that, if she had chosen, but she never answered when they asked her anything, and so they left off asking.
"She's thick, and fat and ugly," said the young green Frogs; "and her children will be just as ugly as she is."
"That may be," retorted the mother-Toad, "but one of them has a jewel in his head, or else I have the jewel."
The young frogs listened and stared; and as these words did not please them, they made grimaces and dived down under the water.
But the little Toads kicked up their hind legs from mere pride, for each of them thought that he must have the jewel; and then they sat and held their heads quite still.
But at length they asked what it was that made them so proud, and what kind of a thing a jewel might be.
"Oh, it is such a splendid and precious thing, that I cannot describe it," said the Mother-Toad.
"It's something which one carries about for one's own pleasure, and that makes other people angry.
But don't ask me any questions, for I shan't answer you."
"Well, I haven't got the jewel," said the smallest of the Toads; she was as ugly as a toad can be.
"Why should I have such a precious thing?
And if it makes others angry, it can't give me any pleasure.
No, I only wish I could get to the edge of the well, and look out; it must be beautiful up there."
"You'd better stay where you are," said the old Mother-Toad, "for you know everything here, and you can tell what you have.
Take care of the bucket, for it will crush you to death; and even if you get into it safely, you may fall out.
And it's not every one who falls so cleverly as I did, and gets away with whole legs and whole bones.
"Quack!" said the little Toad; and that's just as if one of us were to say, "Aha!"
She had an immense desire to get to the edge of the well, and to look over; she felt such a longing for the green, up there; and the next morning, when it chanced that the bucket was being drawn up, filled with water, and stopped for a moment just in front of the stone on which the Toad sat, the little creature's heart moved within it, and our Toad jumped into the filled bucket, which presently was drawn to the top, and emptied out.
"Ugh, you beast!" said the farm laborer who emptied the bucket, when he saw the toad.
"You're the ugliest thing I've seen for one while."
And he made a kick with his wooden shoe at the toad, which just escaped being crushed by managing to scramble into the nettles which grew high by the well's brink.
Here she saw stem by stem, but she looked up also; the sun shone through the leaves, which were quite transparent; and she felt as a person would feel who steps suddenly into a great forest, where the sun looks in between the branches and leaves.
"It's much nicer here than down in the well!
I should like to stay here my whole life long!" said the little Toad.
So she lay there for an hour, yes, for two hours.
"I wonder what is to be found up here?
As I have come so far, I must try to go still farther."
And so she crawled on as fast as she could crawl, and got out upon the highway, where the sun shone upon her, and the dust powdered her all over as she marched across the way.
"I've got to a dry place. now, and no mistake," said the Toad.
"It's almost too much of a good thing here; it tickles one so."
She came to the ditch; and forget-me-nots were growing there, and meadow-sweet; and a very little way off was a hedge of whitethorn, and elder bushes grew there, too, and bindweed with white flowers.
Gay colors were to be seen here, and a butterfly, too, was flitting by.
The Toad thought it was a flower which had broken loose that it might look about better in the world, which was quite a natural thing to do.
"If one could only make such a journey as that!" said the Toad.
"Croak! how capital that would be."
Eight days and eight nights she stayed by the well, and experienced no want of provisions.
On the ninth day she thought, "Forward! onward!"
But what could she find more charming and beautiful?
Perhaps a little toad or a few green frogs.
During the last night there had been a sound borne on the breeze, as if there were cousins in the neighborhood.
"It's a glorious thing to live! glorious to get out of the well, and to lie among the stinging-nettles, and to crawl along the dusty road.
But onward, onward! that we may find frogs or a little toad.
We can't do without that; nature alone is not enough for one."
And so she went forward on her journey.
She came out into the open field, to a great pond, round about which grew reeds; and she walked into it.
"It will be too damp for you here," said the Frogs; "but you are very welcome!
Are you a he or a she?
But it doesn't matter; you are equally welcome."
And she was invited to the concert in the evening- the family concert; great enthusiasm and thin voices; we know the sort of thing.
No refreshments were given, only there was plenty to drink, for the whole pond was free.
"Now I shall resume my journey," said the little Toad; for she always felt a longing for something better.
She saw the stars shining, so large and so bright, and she saw the moon gleaming; and then she saw the sun rise, and mount higher and higher.
"Perhaps after all, I am still in a well, only in a larger well.
I must get higher yet; I feel a great restlessness and longing."
And when the moon became round and full, the poor creature thought, "I wonder if that is the bucket which will be let down, and into which I must step to get higher up?
Or is the sun the great bucket?
How great it is! how bright it is!
It can take up all.
I must look out, that I may not miss the opportunity.
Oh, how it seems to shine in my head!
I don't think the jewel can shine brighter.
But I haven't the jewel; not that I cry about that- no, I must go higher up, into splendor and joy!
I feel so confident, and yet I am afraid.
It's a difficult step to take, and yet it must be taken.
Onward, therefore, straight onward!"
She took a few steps, such as a crawling animal may take, and soon found herself on a road beside which people dwelt; but there were flower gardens as well as kitchen gardens.
And she sat down to rest by a kitchen garden.
"What a number of different creatures there are that I never knew! and how beautiful and great the world is!
But one must look round in it, and not stay in one spot."
And then she hopped into the kitchen garden.
"How green it is here! how beautiful it is here!"
"I know that," said the Caterpillar, on the leaf, "my leaf is the largest here.
It hides half the world from me, but I don't care for the world."
"Cluck, cluck!"
And some fowls came.
They tripped about in the cabbage garden.
The Fowl who marched at the head of them had a long sight, and she spied the Caterpillar on the green leaf, and pecked at it, so that the Caterpillar fell on the ground, where it twisted and writhed.
The Fowl looked at it first with one eye and then with the other, for she did not know what the end of this writhing would be.
"It doesn't do that with a good will," thought the Fowl, and lifted up her head to peck at the Caterpillar.
The Toad was so horrified at this, that she came crawling straight up towards the Fowl.
"Aha, it has allies," quoth the Fowl.
"Just look at the crawling thing!"
And then the Fowl turned away.
"I don't care for the little green morsel; it would only tickle my throat."
The other fowls took the same view of it, and they all turned away together.
"I writhed myself free," said the Caterpillar.
"What a good thing it is when one has presence of mind!
But the hardest thing remains to be done, and that is to get on my leaf again.
Where is it?"
And the little Toad came up and expressed her sympathy.
She was glad that in her ugliness she had frightened the fowls.
"What do you mean by that?" cried the Caterpillar.
"I wriggled myself free from the Fowl.
You are very disagreeable to look at.
Cannot I be left in peace on my own property?
Now I smell cabbage; now I am near my leaf.
Nothing is so beautiful as property.
But I must go higher up."
"Yes, higher up," said the little Toad; "higher-up!
She feels just as I do; but she's not in a good humor to-day.
That's because of the fright.
We all want to go higher up."
And she looked up as high as ever she could.
The stork sat in his nest on the roof of the farm-house.
He clapped with his beak, and the Mother-stork clapped with hers.
"How high up they live!" thought the Toad.
"If one could only get as high as that!"
In the farm-house lived two young students; the one was a poet and the other a scientific searcher into the secrets of nature.
The one sang and wrote joyously of everything that God had created, and how it was mirrored in his heart.
He sang it out clearly, sweetly, richly, in well-sounding verses; while the other investigated created matter itself, and even cut it open where need was.
He looked upon God's creation as a great sum in arithmetic- subtracted, multiplied, and tried to know it within and without, and to talk with understanding concerning it; and that was a very sensible thing; and he spoke joyously and cleverly of it.
They were good, joyful men, those two, "There sits a good specimen of a toad," said the naturalist.
"I must have that fellow in a bottle of spirits."
"You have two of them already," replied the poet.
"Let the thing sit there and enjoy its life."
"But it's so wonderfully ugly," persisted the first.
"Yes, if we could find the jewel in its head," said the poet, "I too should be for cutting it open.'
"A jewel!" cried the naturalist.
"You seem to know a great deal about natural history."
"But is there not something beautiful in the popular belief that just as the toad is the ugliest of animals, it should often carry the most precious jewel in its head?
Is it not just the same thing with men?
What a jewel that was that Aesop had, and still more, Socrates!"
The Toad did not hear any more, nor did she understand half of what she had heard.
The two friends walked on, and thus she escaped the fate of being bottled up in spirits.
"Those two also were speaking of the jewel," said the Toad to herself.
"What a good thing that I have not got it!
I might have been in a very disagreeable position."
Now there was a clapping on the roof of the farm-house.
Father-Stork was making a speech to his family, and his family was glancing down at the two young men in the kitchen garden.
"Man is the most conceited creature!" said the Stork.
"Listen how their jaws are wagging; and for all that they can't clap properly.
They boast of their gifts of eloquence and their language!
Yes, a fine language truly!
Why, it changes in every day's journey we make.
One of them doesn't understand another.
Now, we can speak our language over the whole earth- up in the North and in Egypt.
And then men are not able to fly, moreover.
They rush along by means of an invention they call 'railway;' but they often break their necks over it.
It makes my beak turn cold when I think of it.
The world could get on without men.
We could do without them very well, so long as we only keep frogs and earth-worms."
"That was a powerful speech," thought the little Toad.
"What a great man that is yonder! and how high he sits!
Higher than ever I saw any one sit yet; and how he can swim!" she cried, as the Stork soared away through the air with outspread pinions.
And the Mother-Stork began talking in the nest, and told about Egypt and the waters of the Nile, and the incomparable mud that was to be found in that strange land; and all this sounded new and very charming to the little Toad.
"I must go to Egypt!" said she.
"If the Stork or one of his young ones would only take me!
I would oblige him in return.
Yes, I shall get to Egypt, for I feel so happy!
All the longing and all the pleasure that I feel is much better than having a jewel in one's head."
And it was just she who had the jewel.
That jewel was the continual striving and desire to go upward- ever upward.
It gleamed in her head, gleamed in joy, beamed brightly in her longing.
Then, suddenly, up came the Stork.
He had seen the Toad in the grass, and stooped down and seized the little creature anything but gently.
The Stork's beak pinched her, and the wind whistled; it was not exactly agreeable, but she was going upward- upward towards Egypt- and she knew it; and that was why her eyes gleamed, and a spark seemed to fly out of them.
"Quunk!- ah!"
The body was dead- the Toad was killed!
But the spark that had shot forth from her eyes; what became of that?
The sunbeam took it up; the sunbeam carried the jewel from the head of the toad.
Whither?
Ask not the naturalist; rather ask the poet.
He will tell it thee under the guise of a fairy tale; and the Caterpillar on the cabbage, and the Stork family belong to the story.
Think! the Caterpillar is changed, and turns into a beautiful butterfly; the Stork family flies over mountains and seas, to the distant Africa, and yet finds the shortest way home to the same country- to the same roof.
Nay, that is almost too improbable; and yet it is true.
You may ask the naturalist, he will confess it is so; and you know it yourself, for you have seen it.
But the jewel in the head of the toad?
Seek it in the sun; see it there if you can.
The brightness is too dazzling there.
We have not yet such eyes as can see into the glories which God has created, but we shall receive them by-and-by; and that will be the most beautiful story of all, and we shall all have our share in it.
"NEAR the shores of the great Belt, which is one of the straits that connect the Cattegat with the Baltic, stands an old mansion with thick red walls.
I know every stone of it," says the Wind.
"I saw it when it was part of the castle of Marck Stig on the promontory.
But the castle was obliged to be pulled down, and the stone was used again for the walls of a new mansion on another spot- the baronial residence of Borreby, which still stands near the coast.
I knew them well, those noble lords and ladies, the successive generations that dwelt there; and now I'm going to tell you of Waldemar Daa and his daughters.
How proud was his bearing, for he was of royal blood, and could boast of more noble deeds than merely hunting the stag and emptying the wine-cup.
His rule was despotic: 'It shall be,' he was accustomed to say.
His wife, in garments embroidered with gold, stepped proudly over the polished marble floors.
The tapestries were gorgeous, and the furniture of costly and artistic taste.
She had brought gold and plate with her into the house.
The cellars were full of wine.
Black, fiery horses, neighed in the stables.
There was a look of wealth about the house of Borreby at that time.
They had three children, daughters, fair and delicate maidens- Ida, Joanna, and Anna Dorothea; I have never forgotten their names.
They were a rich, noble family, born in affluence and nurtured in luxury.
"Whir-r-r, whir-r-r!" roared the Wind, and went on, "I did not see in this house, as in other great houses, the high-born lady sitting among her women, turning the spinning-wheel.
She could sweep the sounding chords of the guitar, and sing to the music, not always Danish melodies, but the songs of a strange land.
It was 'Live and let live,' here.
Stranger guests came from far and near, music sounded, goblets clashed, and I," said the Wind, "was not able to drown the noise.
Ostentation, pride, splendor, and display ruled, but not the fear of the Lord.
"It was on the evening of the first day of May," the Wind continued, "I came from the west, and had seen the ships overpowered with the waves, when all on board persisted or were cast shipwrecked on the coast of Jutland.
I had hurried across the heath and over Jutland's wood-girt eastern coast, and over the island of Funen, and then I drove across the great belt, sighing and moaning.
At length I lay down to rest on the shores of Zeeland, near to the great house of Borreby, where the splendid forest of oaks still flourished.
The young men of the neighborhood were collecting branches and brushwood under the oak-trees.
The largest and dryest they could find they carried into the village, and piled them up in a heap and set them on fire.
Then the men and maidens danced, and sung in a circle round the blazing pile.
I lay quite quiet," said the Wind, "but I silently touched a branch which had been brought by one of the handsomest of the young men, and the wood blazed up brightly, blazed brighter than all the rest.
Then he was chosen as the chief, and received the name of the Shepherd; and might choose his lamb from among the maidens.
There was greater mirth and rejoicing than I had ever heard in the halls of the rich baronial house.
Then the noble lady drove by towards the baron's mansion with her three daughters, in a gilded carriage drawn by six horses.
The daughters were young and beautiful- three charming blossoms- a rose, a lily, and a white hyacinth.
The mother was a proud tulip, and never acknowledged the salutations of any of the men or maidens who paused in their sport to do her honor.
The gracious lady seemed like a flower that was rather stiff in the stalk.
Rose, lily, and hyacinth- yes, I saw them all three.
Whose little lambs will they one day become? thought I; their shepherd will be a gallant knight, perhaps a prince.
The carriage rolled on, and the peasants resumed their dancing.
They drove about the summer through all the villages near.
But one night, when I rose again, the high-born lady lay down to rise again no more; that thing came to her which comes to us all, in which there is nothing new.
Waldemar Daa remained for a time silent and thoughtful.
'The loftiest tree may be bowed without being broken,' said a voice within him.
His daughters wept; all the people in the mansion wiped their eyes, but Lady Daa had driven away, and I drove away too," said the Wind.
"Whir-r-r, whir-r-r-!
"I returned again; I often returned and passed over the island of Funen and the shores of the Belt.
Then I rested by Borreby, near the glorious wood, where the heron made his nest, the haunt of the wood-pigeons, the blue-birds, and the black stork.
It was yet spring, some were sitting on their eggs, others had already hatched their young broods; but how they fluttered about and cried out when the axe sounded through the forest, blow upon blow!
The trees of the forest were doomed.
Waldemar Daa wanted to build a noble ship, a man-of-war, a three-decker, which the king would be sure to buy; and these, the trees of the wood, the landmark of the seamen, the refuge of the birds, must be felled.
The hawk started up and flew away, for its nest was destroyed; the heron and all the birds of the forest became homeless, and flew about in fear and anger.
I could well understand how they felt.
Crows and ravens croaked, as if in scorn, while the trees were cracking and falling around them.
Far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working, stood Waldemar Daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, Anna Dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes.
So the tree with the black stork's nest was left standing; the tree itself, however, was not worth much to speak of.
Then there was a great deal of hewing and sawing, and at last the three-decker was built.
The builder was a man of low origin, but possessing great pride; his eyes and forehead spoke of large intellect, and Waldemar Daa was fond of listening to him, and so was Waldemar's daughter Ida, the eldest, now about fifteen years old; and while he was building the ship for the father, he was building for himself a castle in the air, in which he and Ida were to live when they were married.
This might have happened, indeed, if there had been a real castle, with stone walls, ramparts, and a moat.
But in spite of his clever head, the builder was still but a poor, inferior bird; and how can a sparrow expect to be admitted into the society of peacocks?
"I passed on in my course," said the Wind, "and he passed away also.
He was not allowed to remain, and little Ida got over it, because she was obliged to do so.
Proud, black horses, worth looking at, were neighing in the stable.
And they were locked up; for the admiral, who had been sent by the king to inspect the new ship, and make arrangements for its purchase, was loud in admiration of these beautiful horses.
I heard it all," said the Wind, "for I accompanied the gentlemen through the open door of the stable, and strewed stalks of straw, like bars of gold, at their feet.
Waldemar Daa wanted gold, and the admiral wished for the proud black horses; therefore he praised them so much.
But the hint was not taken, and consequently the ship was not bought.
It remained on the shore covered with boards,- a Noah's ark that never got to the water- Whir-r-r-r- and that was a pity.
"In the winter, when the fields were covered with snow, and the water filled with large blocks of ice which I had blown up to the coast," continued the Wind, "great flocks of crows and ravens, dark and black as they usually are, came and alighted on the lonely, deserted ship.
Then they croaked in harsh accents of the forest that now existed no more, of the many pretty birds' nests destroyed and the little ones left without a home; and all for the sake of that great bit of lumber, that proud ship, that never sailed forth.
I made the snowflakes whirl till the snow lay like a great lake round the ship, and drifted over it.
I let it hear my voice, that it might know what the storm has to say.
Certainly I did my part towards teaching it seamanship.
"That winter passed away, and another winter and summer both passed, as they are still passing away, even as I pass away.
The snow drifts onwards, the apple-blossoms are scattered, the leaves fall,- everything passes away, and men are passing away too.
But the great man's daughters are still young, and little Ida is a rose as fair to look upon as on the day when the shipbuilder first saw her.
I often tumbled her long, brown hair, while she stood in the garden by the apple-tree, musing, and not heeding how I strewed the blossoms on her hair, and dishevelled it; or sometimes, while she stood gazing at the red sun and the golden sky through the opening branches of the dark, thick foliage of the garden trees.
Her sister Joanna was bright and slender as a lily; she had a tall and lofty carriage and figure, though, like her mother, rather stiff in back.
She was very fond of walking through the great hall, where hung the portraits of her ancestors.
The women were represented in dresses of velvet and silk, with tiny little hats, embroidered with pearls, on their braided hair.
They were all handsome women.
The gentlemen appeared clad in steel, or in rich cloaks lined with squirrel's fur; they wore little ruffs, and swords at their sides.
Where would Joanna's place be on that wall some day? and how would he look,- her noble lord and husband?
This is what she thought of, and often spoke of in a low voice to herself.
I heard it as I swept into the long hall, and turned round to come out again.
Anna Dorothea, the pale hyacinth, a child of fourteen, was quiet and thoughtful; her large, deep, blue eyes had a dreamy look, but a childlike smile still played round her mouth.
I was not able to blow it away, neither did I wish to do so.
We have met in the garden, in the hollow lane, in the field and meadow, where she gathered herbs and flowers which she knew would be useful to her father in preparing the drugs and mixtures he was always concocting.
Waldemar Daa was arrogant and proud, but he was also a learned man, and knew a great deal.
It was no secret, and many opinions were expressed on what he did.
In his fireplace there was a fire, even in summer time.
He would lock himself in his room, and for days the fire would be kept burning; but he did not talk much of what he was doing.
The secret powers of nature are generally discovered in solitude, and did he not soon expect to find out the art of making the greatest of all good things- the art of making gold?
So he fondly hoped; therefore the chimney smoked and the fire crackled so constantly.
Yes, I was there too," said the Wind.
"'Leave it alone,' I sang down the chimney; 'leave it alone, it will all end in smoke, air, coals, and ashes, and you will burn your fingers.'
But Waldemar Daa did not leave it alone, and all he possessed vanished like smoke blown by me.
The splendid black horses, where are they?
What became of the cows in the field, the old gold and silver vessels in cupboards and chests, and even the house and home itself?
It was easy to melt all these away in the gold-making crucible, and yet obtain no gold.
And so it was.
Empty are the barns and store-rooms, the cellars and cupboards; the servants decreased in number, and the mice multiplied.
First one window became broken, and then another, so that I could get in at other places besides the door.
'Where the chimney smokes, the meal is being cooked,' says the proverb; but here a chimney smoked that devoured all the meals for the sake of gold.
I blew round the courtyard," said the Wind, "like a watchman blowing his home, but no watchman was there.
I twirled the weather-cock round on the summit of the tower, and it creaked like the snoring of a warder, but no warder was there; nothing but mice and rats.
Poverty laid the table-cloth; poverty sat in the wardrobe and in the larder.
The door fell off its hinges, cracks and fissures made their appearance everywhere; so that I could go in and out at pleasure, and that is how I know all about it.
Amid smoke and ashes, sorrow, and sleepless nights, the hair and beard of the master of the house turned gray, and deep furrows showed themselves around his temples; his skin turned pale and yellow, while his eyes still looked eagerly for gold, the longed-for gold, and the result of his labor was debt instead of gain.
I blew the smoke and ashes into his face and beard; I moaned through the broken window-panes, and the yawning clefts in the walls; I blew into the chests and drawers belonging to his daughters, wherein lay the clothes that had become faded and threadbare, from being worn over and over again.
Such a song had not been sung, at the children's cradle as I sung now.
The lordly life had changed to a life of penury.
I was the only one who rejoiced aloud in that castle," said the Wind.
"At last I snowed them up, and they say snow keeps people warm.
It was good for them, for they had no wood, and the forest, from which they might have obtained it, had been cut down.
The frost was very bitter, and I rushed through loop-holes and passages, over gables and roofs with keen and cutting swiftness.
The three high-born daughters were lying in bed because of the cold, and their father crouching beneath his leather coverlet.
Nothing to eat, nothing to burn, no fire on the hearth!
Here was a life for high-born people!
'Give it up, give it up!'
But my Lord Daa would not do that.
'After winter, spring will come,' he said, 'after want, good times.
We must not lose patience, we must learn to wait.
Now my horses and lands are all mortgaged, it is indeed high time; but gold will come at last- at Easter.'
"I heard him as he thus spoke; he was looking at a spider's web, and he continued, 'Thou cunning little weaver, thou dost teach me perseverance.
Let any one tear thy web, and thou wilt begin again and repair it.
Let it be entirely destroyed, thou wilt resolutely begin to make another till it is completed.
So ought we to do, if we wish to succeed at last.'
"It was the morning of Easter-day.
The bells sounded from the neighboring church, and the sun seemed to rejoice in the sky.
The master of the castle had watched through the night, in feverish excitement, and had been melting and cooling, distilling and mixing.
I heard him sighing like a soul in despair; I heard him praying, and I noticed how he held his breath.
The lamp burnt out, but he did not observe it.
I blew up the fire in the coals on the hearth, and it threw a red glow on his ghastly white face, lighting it up with a glare, while his sunken eyes looked out wildly from their cavernous depths, and appeared to grow larger and more prominent, as if they would burst from their sockets.
'Look at the alchymic glass,' he cried; 'something glows in the crucible, pure and heavy.'
He lifted it with a trembling hand, and exclaimed in a voice of agitation, 'Gold! gold!'
He was quite giddy, I could have blown him down," said the Wind; "but I only fanned the glowing coals, and accompanied him through the door to the room where his daughter sat shivering.
His coat was powdered with ashes, and there were ashes in his beard and in his tangled hair.
He stood erect, and held high in the air the brittle glass that contained his costly treasure.
'Found! found!
Gold! gold!' he shouted, again holding the glass aloft, that it might flash in the sunshine; but his hand trembled, and the alchymic glass fell from it, clattering to the ground, and brake in a thousand pieces.
The last bubble of his happiness had burst, with a whiz and a whir, and I rushed away from the gold-maker's house.
"Late in the autumn, when the days were short, and the mist sprinkled cold drops on the berries and the leafless branches, I came back in fresh spirits, rushed through the air, swept the sky clear, and snapped off the dry twigs, which is certainly no great labor to do, yet it must be done.
There was another kind of sweeping taking place at Waldemar Daa's, in the castle of Borreby.
His enemy, Owe Ramel, of Basnas, was there, with the mortgage of the house and everything it contained, in his pocket.
I rattled the broken windows, beat against the old rotten doors, and whistled through cracks and crevices, so that Mr. Owe Ramel did not much like to remain there.
Ida and Anna Dorothea wept bitterly, Joanna stood, pale and proud, biting her lips till the blood came; but what could that avail?
Owe Ramel offered Waldemar Daa permission to remain in the house till the end of his life.
No one thanked him for the offer, and I saw the ruined old gentleman lift his head, and throw it back more proudly than ever.
Then I rushed against the house and the old lime-trees with such force, that one of the thickest branches, a decayed one, was broken off, and the branch fell at the entrance, and remained there.
It might have been used as a broom, if any one had wanted to sweep the place out, and a grand sweeping-out there really was; I thought it would be so.
It was hard for any one to preserve composure on such a day; but these people had strong wills, as unbending as their hard fortune.
There was nothing they could call their own, excepting the clothes they wore.
Yes, there was one thing more, an alchymist's glass, a new one, which had been lately bought, and filled with what could be gathered from the ground of the treasure which had promised so much but failed in keeping its promise.
Waldemar Daa hid the glass in his bosom, and, taking his stick in his hand, the once rich gentleman passed with his daughters out of the house of Borreby.
I blew coldly upon his flustered cheeks, I stroked his gray beard and his long white hair, and I sang as well as I was able, 'Whir-r-r, whir-r-r.
Gone away!
Gone away!'
Ida walked on one side of the old man, and Anna Dorothea on the other; Joanna turned round, as they left the entrance.
Why?
Fortune would not turn because she turned.
She looked at the stone in the walls which had once formed part of the castle of Marck Stig, and perhaps she thought of his daughters and of the old song,-
"The eldest and youngest, hand-in-hand, Went forth alone to a distant land."
These were only two; here there were three, and their father with them also.
They walked along the high-road, where once they had driven in their splendid carriage; they went forth with their father as beggars.
They wandered across an open field to a mud hut, which they rented for a dollar and a half a year, a new home, with bare walls and empty cupboards.
Crows and magpies fluttered about them, and cried, as if in contempt, 'Caw, caw, turned out of our nest- caw, caw,' as they had done in the wood at Borreby, when the trees were felled.
Daa and his daughters could not help hearing it, so I blew about their ears to drown the noise; what use was it that they should listen?
So they went to live in the mud hut in the open field, and I wandered away, over moor and meadow, through bare bushes and leafless forests, to the open sea, to the broad shores in other lands, 'Whir-r-r, whir-r-r!
Away, away!' year after year."
And what became of Waldemar Daa and his daughters?
Listen; the Wind will tell us: "The last I saw of them was the pale hyacinth, Anna Dorothea.
She was old and bent then; for fifty years had passed and she had outlived them all.
She could relate the history.
Yonder, on the heath, near the town of Wiborg, in Jutland, stood the fine new house of the canon.
It was built of red brick, with projecting gables.
It was inhabited, for the smoke curled up thickly from the chimneys.
The canon's gentle lady and her beautiful daughters sat in the bay-window, and looked over the hawthorn hedge of the garden towards the brown heath.
What were they looking at?
Their glances fell upon a stork's nest, which was built upon an old tumbledown hut.
The roof, as far as one existed at all, was covered with moss and lichen.
The stork's nest covered the greater part of it, and that alone was in a good condition; for it was kept in order by the stork himself.
That is a house to be looked at, and not to be touched," said the Wind.
"For the sake of the stork's nest it had been allowed to remain, although it is a blot on the landscape.
They did not like to drive the stork away; therefore the old shed was left standing, and the poor woman who dwelt in it allowed to stay.
She had the Egyptian bird to thank for that; or was it perchance her reward for having once interceded for the preservation of the nest of its black brother in the forest of Borreby?
At that time she, the poor woman, was a young child, a white hyacinth in a rich garden.
She remembered that time well; for it was Anna Dorothea.
"'O-h, o-h,' she sighed; for people can sigh like the moaning of the wind among the reeds and rushes.
'O-h, o-h,' she would say, 'no bell sounded at thy burial, Waldemar Daa.
The poor school-boys did not even sing a psalm when the former lord of Borreby was laid in the earth to rest.
O-h, everything has an end, even misery.
Sister Ida became the wife of a peasant; that was the hardest trial which befell our father, that the husband of his own daughter should be a miserable serf, whom his owner could place for punishment on the wooden horse.
I suppose he is under the ground now; and Ida- alas! alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that I am!
Kind Heaven, grant me that I may die.'
"That was Anna Dorothea's prayer in the wretched hut that was left standing for the sake of the stork.
I took pity on the proudest of the sisters," said the Wind.
"Her courage was like that of a man; and in man's clothes she served as a sailor on board ship.
She was of few words, and of a dark countenance; but she did not know how to climb, so I blew her overboard before any one found out that she was a woman; and, in my opinion, that was well done," said the Wind.
On such another Easter morning as that on which Waldemar Daa imagined he had discovered the art of making gold, I heard the tones of a psalm under the stork's nest, and within the crumbling walls.
It was Anna Dorothea's last song.
There was no window in the hut, only a hole in the wall; and the sun rose like a globe of burnished gold, and looked through.
With what splendor he filled that dismal dwelling!
Her eyes were glazing, and her heart breaking; but so it would have been, even had the sun not shone that morning on Anna Dorothea.
The stork's nest had secured her a home till her death.
I sung over her grave; I sung at her father's grave.
I know where it lies, and where her grave is too, but nobody else knows it.
"New times now; all is changed.
The old high-road is lost amid cultivated fields; the new one now winds along over covered graves; and soon the railway will come, with its train of carriages, and rush over graves where lie those whose very names are forgoten.
All passed away, passed away!
"This is the story of Waldemar Daa and his daughters.
Tell it better, any of you, if you know how," said the Wind; and he rushed away, and was gone.
THERE were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon.
They shouldered arms and looked straight before them, and wore a splendid uniform, red and blue.
The first thing in the world they ever heard were the words, "Tin soldiers!" uttered by a little boy, who clapped his hands with delight when the lid of the box, in which they lay, was taken off.
They were given him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up.
The soldiers were all exactly alike, excepting one, who had only one leg; he had been left to the last, and then there was not enough of the melted tin to finish him, so they made him to stand firmly on one leg, and this caused him to be very remarkable.
The table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle.
Through the small windows the rooms could be seen.
In front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake.
Swans, made of wax, swam on the lake, and were reflected in it.
All this was very pretty, but the prettiest of all was a tiny little lady, who stood at the open door of the castle; she, also, was made of paper, and she wore a dress of clear muslin, with a narrow blue ribbon over her shoulders just like a scarf.
In front of these was fixed a glittering tinsel rose, as large as her whole face.
The little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only one leg.
"That is the wife for me," he thought; "but she is too grand, and lives in a castle, while I have only a box to live in, five-and-twenty of us altogether, that is no place for her.
Still I must try and make her acquaintance."
Then he laid himself at full length on the table behind a snuff-box that stood upon it, so that he could peep at the little delicate lady, who continued to stand on one leg without losing her balance.
When evening came, the other tin soldiers were all placed in the box, and the people of the house went to bed.
Then the playthings began to have their own games together, to pay visits, to have sham fights, and to give balls.
The tin soldiers rattled in their box; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not open the lid.
The nut-crackers played at leap-frog, and the pencil jumped about the table.
There was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too.
Only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places.
She stood on tiptoe, with her legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg.
He never took his eyes from her for even a moment.
The clock struck twelve, and, with a bounce, up sprang the lid of the snuff-box; but, instead of snuff, there jumped up a little black goblin; for the snuff-box was a toy puzzle.
"Tin soldier," said the goblin, "don't wish for what does not belong to you.
But the tin soldier pretended not to hear.
"Very well; wait till to-morrow, then," said the goblin.
When the children came in the next morning, they placed the tin soldier in the window.
Now, whether it was the goblin who did it, or the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and out fell the tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story, into the street beneath.
It was a terrible fall; for he came head downwards, his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and his one leg up in the air.
The servant maid and the little boy went down stairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him.
If he had called out, "Here I am," it would have been all right, but he was too proud to cry out for help while he wore a uniform.
Presently it began to rain, and the drops fell faster and faster, till there was a heavy shower.
When it was over, two boys happened to pass by, and one of them said, "Look, there is a tin soldier.
He ought to have a boat to sail in."
So they made a boat out of a newspaper, and placed the tin soldier in it, and sent him sailing down the gutter, while the two boys ran by the side of it, and clapped their hands.
Good gracious, what large waves arose in that gutter! and how fast the stream rolled on! for the rain had been very heavy.
The paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket.
Suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain, and then it was as dark as the tin soldier's box.
"Where am I going now?" thought he.
"This is the black goblin's fault, I am sure.
Ah, well, if the little lady were only here with me in the boat, I should not care for any darkness."
Suddenly there appeared a great water-rat, who lived in the drain.
"Have you a passport?" asked the rat, "give it to me at once."
But the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever.
The boat sailed on and the rat followed it.
How he did gnash his teeth and cry out to the bits of wood and straw, "Stop him, stop him; he has not paid toll, and has not shown his pass."
But the stream rushed on stronger and stronger.
The tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended.
Then he heard a roaring sound quite terrible enough to frighten the bravest man.
At the end of the tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place, which made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us.
He was too close to it to stop, so the boat rushed on, and the poor tin soldier could only hold himself as stiffly as possible, without moving an eyelid, to show that he was not afraid.
The boat whirled round three or four times, and then filled with water to the very edge; nothing could save it from sinking.
He now stood up to his neck in water, while deeper and deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft and loose with the wet, till at last the water closed over the soldier's head.
He thought of the elegant little dancer whom he should never see again, and the words of the song sounded in his ears-
"Farewell, warrior! ever brave, Drifting onward to thy grave."
Then the paper boat fell to pieces, and the soldier sank into the water and immediately afterwards was swallowed up by a great fish.
Oh how dark it was inside the fish!
A great deal darker than in the tunnel, and narrower too, but the tin soldier continued firm, and lay at full length shouldering his musket.
The fish swam to and fro, making the most wonderful movements, but at last he became quite still.
After a while, a flash of lightning seemed to pass through him, and then the daylight approached, and a voice cried out, "I declare here is the tin soldier."
The fish had been caught, taken to the market and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife.
She picked up the soldier and held him by the waist between her finger and thumb, and carried him into the room.
They were all anxious to see this wonderful soldier who had travelled about inside a fish; but he was not at all proud.
They placed him on the table, and- how many curious things do happen in the world!- there he was in the very same room from the window of which he had fallen, there were the same children, the same playthings, standing on the table, and the pretty castle with the elegant little dancer at the door; she still balanced herself on one leg, and held up the other, so she was as firm as himself.
It touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back.
He only looked at her and they both remained silent.
Presently one of the little boys took up the tin soldier, and threw him into the stove.
He had no reason for doing so, therefore it must have been the fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuff-box.
The flames lighted up the tin soldier, as he stood, the heat was very terrible, but whether it proceeded from the real fire or from the fire of love he could not tell.
Then he could see that the bright colors were faded from his uniform, but whether they had been washed off during his journey or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say.
He looked at the little lady, and she looked at him.
He felt himself melting away, but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder.
Suddenly the door of the room flew open and the draught of air caught up the little dancer, she fluttered like a sylph right into the stove by the side of the tin soldier, and was instantly in flames and was gone.
The tin soldier melted down into a lump, and the next morning, when the maid servant took the ashes out of the stove, she found him in the shape of a little tin heart.
But of the little dancer nothing remained but the tinsel rose, which was burnt black as a cinder.
A SOLDIER came marching along the high road: "Left, right- left, right."
He had his knapsack on his back, and a sword at his side; he had been to the wars, and was now returning home.
As he walked on, he met a very frightful-looking old witch in the road.
Her under-lip hung quite down on her breast, and she stopped and said, "Good evening, soldier; you have a very fine sword, and a large knapsack, and you are a real soldier; so you shall have as much money as ever you like."
"Thank you, old witch," said the soldier.
"Do you see that large tree," said the witch, pointing to a tree which stood beside them.
"Well, it is quite hollow inside, and you must climb to the top, when you will see a hole, through which you can let yourself down into the tree to a great depth.
I will tie a rope round your body, so that I can pull you up again when you call out to me."
"But what am I to do, down there in the tree?" asked the soldier.
"Get money," she replied; "for you must know that when you reach the ground under the tree, you will find yourself in a large hall, lighted up by three hundred lamps; you will then see three doors, which can be easily opened, for the keys are in all the locks.
On entering the first of the chambers, to which these doors lead, you will see a large chest, standing in the middle of the floor, and upon it a dog seated, with a pair of eyes as large as teacups.
But you need not be at all afraid of him; I will give you my blue checked apron, which you must spread upon the floor, and then boldly seize hold of the dog, and place him upon it.
You can then open the chest, and take from it as many pence as you please, they are only copper pence; but if you would rather have silver money, you must go into the second chamber.
Here you will find another dog, with eyes as big as mill-wheels; but do not let that trouble you.
Place him upon my apron, and then take what money you please.
If, however, you like gold best, enter the third chamber, where there is another chest full of it.
The dog who sits on this chest is very dreadful; his eyes are as big as a tower, but do not mind him.
If he also is placed upon my apron, he cannot hurt you, and you may take from the chest what gold you will."
"This is not a bad story," said the soldier; "but what am I to give you, you old witch? for, of course, you do not mean to tell me all this for nothing."
"No," said the witch; "but I do not ask for a single penny.
Only promise to bring me an old tinder-box, which my grandmother left behind the last time she went down there."
"Very well; I promise.
Now tie the rope round my body."
"Here it is," replied the witch; "and here is my blue checked apron."
As soon as the rope was tied, the soldier climbed up the tree, and let himself down through the hollow to the ground beneath; and here he found, as the witch had told him, a large hall, in which many hundred lamps were all burning.
Then he opened the first door.
"Ah!" there sat the dog, with the eyes as large as teacups, staring at him.
"You're a pretty fellow," said the soldier, seizing him, and placing him on the witch's apron, while he filled his pockets from the chest with as many pieces as they would hold.
Then he closed the lid, seated the dog upon it again, and walked into another chamber, And, sure enough, there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels.
"You had better not look at me in that way," said the soldier; "you will make your eyes water;" and then he seated him also upon the apron, and opened the chest.
But when he saw what a quantity of silver money it contained, he very quickly threw away all the coppers he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with nothing but silver.
Then he went into the third room, and there the dog was really hideous; his eyes were, truly, as big as towers, and they turned round and round in his head like wheels.
"Good morning," said the soldier, touching his cap, for he had never seen such a dog in his life.
But after looking at him more closely, he thought he had been civil enough, so he placed him on the floor, and opened the chest.
Good gracious, what a quantity of gold there was! enough to buy all the sugar-sticks of the sweet-stuff women; all the tin soldiers, whips, and rocking-horses in the world, or even the whole town itself There was, indeed, an immense quantity.
So the soldier now threw away all the silver money he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with gold instead; and not only his pockets and his knapsack, but even his cap and boots, so that he could scarcely walk.
He was really rich now; so he replaced the dog on the chest, closed the door, and called up through the tree, "Now pull me out, you old witch."
"Have you got the tinder-box?" asked the witch.
"No; I declare I quite forgot it."
So he went back and fetched the tinderbox, and then the witch drew him up out of the tree, and he stood again in the high road, with his pockets, his knapsack, his cap, and his boots full of gold.
"What are you going to do with the tinder-box?" asked the soldier.
"That is nothing to you," replied the witch; "you have the money, now give me the tinder-box."
"I tell you what," said the soldier, "if you don't tell me what you are going to do with it, I will draw my sword and cut off your head."
"No," said the witch.
The soldier immediately cut off her head, and there she lay on the ground.
Then he tied up all his money in her apron. and slung it on his back like a bundle, put the tinderbox in his pocket, and walked off to the nearest town.
It was a very nice town, and he put up at the best inn, and ordered a dinner of all his favorite dishes, for now he was rich and had plenty of money.
The servant, who cleaned his boots, thought they certainly were a shabby pair to be worn by such a rich gentleman, for he had not yet bought any new ones.
The next day, however, he procured some good clothes and proper boots, so that our soldier soon became known as a fine gentleman, and the people visited him, and told him all the wonders that were to be seen in the town, and of the king's beautiful daughter, the princess.
"Where can I see her?" asked the soldier.
"She is not to be seen at all," they said; "she lives in a large copper castle, surrounded by walls and towers.
No one but the king himself can pass in or out, for there has been a prophecy that she will marry a common soldier, and the king cannot bear to think of such a marriage."
"I should like very much to see her," thought the soldier; but he could not obtain permission to do so.
However, he passed a very pleasant time; went to the theatre, drove in the king's garden, and gave a great deal of money to the poor, which was very good of him; he remembered what it had been in olden times to be without a shilling.
Now he was rich, had fine clothes, and many friends, who all declared he was a fine fellow and a real gentleman, and all this gratified him exceedingly.
But his money would not last forever; and as he spent and gave away a great deal daily, and received none, he found himself at last with only two shillings left.
So he was obliged to leave his elegant rooms, and live in a little garret under the roof, where he had to clean his own boots, and even mend them with a large needle.
None of his friends came to see him, there were too many stairs to mount up.
One dark evening, he had not even a penny to buy a candle; then all at once he remembered that there was a piece of candle stuck in the tinder-box, which he had brought from the old tree, into which the witch had helped him.
He found the tinder-box, but no sooner had he struck a few sparks from the flint and steel, than the door flew open and the dog with eyes as big as teacups, whom he had seen while down in the tree, stood before him, and said, "What orders, master?"
"Hallo," said the soldier; "well this is a pleasant tinderbox, if it brings me all I wish for."
"Bring me some money," said he to the dog.
He was gone in a moment, and presently returned, carrying a large bag of coppers in his month.
The soldier very soon discovered after this the value of the tinder-box.
If he struck the flint once, the dog who sat on the chest of copper money made his appearance; if twice, the dog came from the chest of silver; and if three times, the dog with eyes like towers, who watched over the gold.
The soldier had now plenty of money; he returned to his elegant rooms, and reappeared in his fine clothes, so that his friends knew him again directly, and made as much of him as before.
After a while he began to think it was very strange that no one could get a look at the princess.
"Every one says she is very beautiful," thought he to himself; "but what is the use of that if she is to be shut up in a copper castle surrounded by so many towers.
Can I by any means get to see her.
Stop! where is my tinder-box?"
Then he struck a light, and in a moment the dog, with eyes as big as teacups, stood before him.
"It is midnight," said the soldier, "yet I should very much like to see the princess, if only for a moment."
The dog disappeared instantly, and before the soldier could even look round, he returned with the princess.
She was lying on the dog's back asleep, and looked so lovely, that every one who saw her would know she was a real princess.
The soldier could not help kissing her, true soldier as he was.
Then the dog ran back with the princess; but in the morning, while at breakfast with the king and queen, she told them what a singular dream she had had during the night, of a dog and a soldier, that she had ridden on the dog's back, and been kissed by the soldier.
"That is a very pretty story, indeed," said the queen.
So the next night one of the old ladies of the court was set to watch by the princess's bed, to discover whether it really was a dream, or what else it might be.
The soldier longed very much to see the princess once more, so he sent for the dog again in the night to fetch her, and to run with her as fast as ever he could.
But the old lady put on water boots, and ran after him as quickly as he did, and found that he carried the princess into a large house.
She thought it would help her to remember the place if she made a large cross on the door with a piece of chalk.
Then she went home to bed, and the dog presently returned with the princess.
But when he saw that a cross had been made on the door of the house, where the soldier lived, he took another piece of chalk and made crosses on all the doors in the town, so that the lady-in-waiting might not be able to find out the right door.
Early the next morning the king and queen accompanied the lady and all the officers of the household, to see where the princess had been.
"Here it is," said the king, when they came to the first door with a cross on it.
No, my dear husband, it must be that one," said the queen, pointing to a second door having a cross also.
"And here is one, and there is another!" they all exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction.
So they felt it would be useless to search any farther.
But the queen was a very clever woman; she could do a great deal more than merely ride in a carriage.
She took her large gold scissors, cut a piece of silk into squares, and made a neat little bag.
This bag she filled with buckwheat flour, and tied it round the princess's neck; and then she cut a small hole in the bag, so that the flour might be scattered on the ground as the princess went along.
During the night, the dog came again and carried the princess on his back, and ran with her to the soldier, who loved her very much, and wished that he had been a prince, so that he might have her for a wife.
The dog did not observe how the flour ran out of the bag all the way from the castle wall to the soldier's house, and even up to the window, where he had climbed with the princess.
Therefore in the morning the king and queen found out where their daughter had been, and the soldier was taken up and put in prison.
Oh, how dark and disagreeable it was as he sat there, and the people said to him, "To-morrow you will be hanged."
It was not very pleasant news, and besides, he had left the tinder-box at the inn.
In the morning he could see through the iron grating of the little window how the people were hastening out of the town to see him hanged; he heard the drums beating, and saw the soldiers marching.
Every one ran out to look at them. and a shoemaker's boy, with a leather apron and slippers on, galloped by so fast, that one of his slippers flew off and struck against the wall where the soldier sat looking through the iron grating.
"Hallo, you shoemaker's boy, you need not be in such a hurry," cried the soldier to him.
"There will be nothing to see till I come; but if you will run to the house where I have been living, and bring me my tinder-box, you shall have four shillings, but you must put your best foot foremost."
The shoemaker's boy liked the idea of getting the four shillings, so he ran very fast and fetched the tinder-box, and gave it to the soldier.
And now we shall see what happened.
Outside the town a large gibbet had been erected, round which stood the soldiers and several thousands of people.
The king and the queen sat on splendid thrones opposite to the judges and the whole council.
The soldier already stood on the ladder; but as they were about to place the rope around his neck, he said that an innocent request was often granted to a poor criminal before he suffered death.
He wished very much to smoke a pipe, as it would be the last pipe he should ever smoke in the world.
The king could not refuse this request, so the soldier took his tinder-box, and struck fire, once, twice, thrice,- and there in a moment stood all the dogs;- the one with eyes as big as teacups, the one with eyes as large as mill-wheels, and the third, whose eyes were like towers.
"Help me now, that I may not be hanged," cried the soldier.
And the dogs fell upon the judges and all the councillors; seized one by the legs, and another by the nose, and tossed them many feet high in the air, so that they fell down and were dashed to pieces.
"I will not be touched," said the king.
But the largest dog seized him, as well as the queen, and threw them after the others.
Then the soldiers and all the people were afraid, and cried, "Good soldier, you shall be our king, and you shall marry the beautiful princess."
So they placed the soldier in the king's carriage, and the three dogs ran on in front and cried "Hurrah!" and the little boys whistled through their fingers, and the soldiers presented arms.
The princess came out of the copper castle, and became queen, which was very pleasing to her.
The wedding festivities lasted a whole week, and the dogs sat at the table, and stared with all their eyes.
A WHIPPING TOP and a little ball lay together in a box, among other toys, and the top said to the ball, "Shall we be married, as we live in the same box?"
But the ball, which wore a dress of morocco leather, and thought as much of herself as any other young lady, would not even condescend to reply.
The next day came the little boy to whom the playthings belonged, and he painted the top red and yellow, and drove a brass-headed nail into the middle, so that while the top was spinning round it looked splendid.
"Look at me," said the top to the ball.
"What do you say now?
Shall we be engaged to each other?
We should suit so well; you spring, and I dance.
No one could be happier than we should be."
"Indeed! do you think so?
Perhaps you do not know that my father and mother were morocco slippers, and that I have a Spanish cork in my body."
"Yes; but I am made of mahogany," said the top.
"The major himself turned me.
He has a turning lathe of his own, and it is a great amusement to him."
"Can I believe it?" asked the ball.
"May I never be whipped again," said the top, "if I am not telling you the truth."
"You certainly know how to speak for yourself very well," said the ball; "but I cannot accept your proposal.
I am almost engaged to a swallow.
Every time I fly up in the air, he puts his head out of the nest, and says, 'Will you?' and I have said, 'Yes,' to myself silently, and that is as good as being half engaged; but I will promise never to forget you."
"Much good that will be to me," said the top; and they spoke to each other no more.
Next day the ball was taken out by the boy.
The top saw it flying high in the air, like a bird, till it would go quite out of sight.
Each time it came back, as it touched the earth, it gave a higher leap than before, either because it longed to fly upwards, or from having a Spanish cork in its body.
But the ninth time it rose in the air, it remained away, and did not return.
The boy searched everywhere for it, but he searched in vain, for it could not be found; it was gone.
"I know very well where she is," sighed the top; "she is in the swallow's nest, and has married the swallow."
The more the top thought of this, the more he longed for the ball.
His love increased the more, just because he could not get her; and that she should have been won by another, was the worst of all.
The top still twirled about and hummed, but he continued to think of the ball; and the more he thought of her, the more beautiful she seemed to his fancy.
Thus several years passed by, and his love became quite old.
The top, also, was no longer young; but there came a day when he looked handsomer than ever; for he was gilded all over.
He was now a golden top, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite loud, and was something worth looking at; but one day he leaped too high, and then he, also, was gone.
They searched everywhere, even in the cellar, but he was nowhere to be found.
Where could he be?
He had jumped into the dust-bin, where all sorts of rubbish were lying: cabbage-stalks, dust, and rain-droppings that had fallen down from the gutter under the roof.
"Now I am in a nice place," said he; "my gilding will soon be washed off here.
Oh dear, what a set of rabble I have got amongst!"
And then he glanced at a curious round thing like an old apple, which lay near a long, leafless cabbage-stalk.
It was, however, not an apple, but an old ball, which had lain for years in the gutter, and was soaked through with water.
"Thank goodness, here comes one of my own class, with whom I can talk," said the ball, examining the gilded top.
"I am made of morocco," she said.
"I was sewn together by a young lady, and I have a Spanish cork in my body; but no one would think it, to look at me now.
I was once engaged to a swallow; but I fell in here from the gutter under the roof, and I have lain here more than five years, and have been thoroughly drenched.
Believe me, it is a long time for a young maiden."
The top said nothing, but he thought of his old love; and the more she said, the more clear it became to him that this was the same ball.
The servant then came to clean out the dust-bin.
"Ah," she exclaimed, "here is a gilt top."
So the top was brought again to notice and honor, but nothing more was heard of the little ball.
He spoke not a word about his old love; for that soon died away.
When the beloved object has lain for five years in a gutter, and has been drenched through, no one cares to know her again on meeting her in a dust-bin.
IT was lovely summer weather in the country, and the golden corn, the green oats, and the haystacks piled up in the meadows looked beautiful.
The stork walking about on his long red legs chattered in the Egyptian language, which he had learnt from his mother.
The corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools.
It was, indeed, delightful to walk about in the country.
In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright.
The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood.
In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors.
The other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks, and sit under a burdock leaf, to have a gossip with her.
At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, "Peep, peep."
"Quack, quack," said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves.
Their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked, because green is good for the eyes.
"How large the world is," said the young ducks, when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg-shell.
"Do you imagine this is the whole world?" asked the mother; "Wait till you have seen the garden; it stretches far beyond that to the parson's field, but I have never ventured to such a distance.
Are you all out?" she continued, rising; "No, I declare, the largest egg lies there still.
I wonder how long this is to last, I am quite tired of it;" and she seated herself again on the nest.
"Well, how are you getting on?" asked an old duck, who paid her a visit.
"One egg is not hatched yet," said the duck, "it will not break.
But just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw?
They are the image of their father, who is so unkind, he never comes to see."
"Let me see the egg that will not break," said the duck; "I have no doubt it is a turkey's egg.
I was persuaded to hatch some once, and after all my care and trouble with the young ones, they were afraid of the water.
I quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose.
I could not get them to venture in.
Let me look at the egg.
Yes, that is a turkey's egg; take my advice, leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim."
"I think I will sit on it a little while longer," said the duck; "as I have sat so long already, a few days will be nothing."
"Please yourself," said the old duck, and she went away.
At last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, "Peep, peep."
It was very large and ugly.
The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others.
I wonder if it really is a turkey.
We shall soon find it out, however when we go to the water.
It must go in, if I have to push it myself."
On the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash.
"Quack, quack," cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in.
The water closed over their heads, but they came up again in an instant, and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them as easily as possible, and the ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them.
"Oh," said the mother, "that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself!
He is my own child, and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly.
Quack, quack! come with me now, I will take you into grand society, and introduce you to the farmyard, but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon; and, above all, beware of the cat."
When they reached the farmyard, there was a great disturbance, two families were fighting for an eel's head, which, after all, was carried off by the cat.
"See, children, that is the way of the world," said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself.
"Come, now, use your legs, and let me see how well you can behave.
You must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder; she is the highest born of them all, and has Spanish blood, therefore, she is well off.
Don't you see she has a red flag tied to her leg, which is something very grand, and a great honor for a duck; it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her, as she can be recognized both by man and beast.
Come, now, don't turn your toes, a well-bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart, just like his father and mother, in this way; now bend your neck, and say 'quack.'"
The ducklings did as they were bid, but the other duck stared, and said, "Look, here comes another brood, as if there were not enough of us already! and what a queer looking object one of them is; we don't want him here," and then one flew out and bit him in the neck.
"Let him alone," said the mother; "he is not doing any harm."
"Yes, but he is so big and ugly," said the spiteful duck "and therefore he must be turned out."
"The others are very pretty children," said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, "all but that one; I wish his mother could improve him a little."
"That is impossible, your grace," replied the mother; "he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others.
I think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, "It is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence.
I think he will grow up strong, and able to take care of himself."
"The other ducklings are graceful enough," said the old duck.
"Now make yourself at home, and if you can find an eel's head, you can bring it to me."
And so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry.
"He is too big," they all said, and the turkey cock, who had been born into the world with spurs, and fancied himself really an emperor, puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail, and flew at the duckling, and became quite red in the head with passion, so that the poor little thing did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard.
So it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse.
The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, "Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you," and his mother said she wished he had never been born.
The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet.
So at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings.
"They are afraid of me because I am ugly," he said.
So he closed his eyes, and flew still farther, until he came out on a large moor, inhabited by wild ducks.
Here he remained the whole night, feeling very tired and sorrowful.
In the morning, when the wild ducks rose in the air, they stared at their new comrade.
"What sort of a duck are you?" they all said, coming round him.
He bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question.
"You are exceedingly ugly," said the wild ducks, "but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family."
Poor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor.
After he had been on the moor two days, there came two wild geese, or rather goslings, for they had not been out of the egg long, and were very saucy.
"Listen, friend," said one of them to the duckling, "you are so ugly, that we like you very well.
Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage?
Not far from here is another moor, in which there are some pretty wild geese, all unmarried.
It is a chance for you to get a wife; you may be lucky, ugly as you are."
"Pop, pop," sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood.
"Pop, pop," echoed far and wide in the distance, and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes.
The sound continued from every direction, for the sportsmen surrounded the moor, and some were even seated on branches of trees, overlooking the rushes.
The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees, and as it floated away across the water, a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes, which bent beneath them wherever they went.
How they terrified the poor duckling!
He turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him.
His jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully.
He thrust his nose close to the duckling, showing his sharp teeth, and then, "splash, splash," he went into the water without touching him, "Oh," sighed the duckling, "how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me."
And so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him.
It was late in the day before all became quiet, but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move.
He waited quietly for several hours, and then, after looking carefully around him, hastened away from the moor as fast as he could.
He ran over field and meadow till a storm arose, and he could hardly struggle against it.
Towards evening, he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall, and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first.
The storm continued so violent, that the duckling could go no farther; he sat down by the cottage, and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way.
There was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through, which he did very quietly, and got a shelter for the night.
A woman, a tom cat, and a hen lived in this cottage.
The tom cat, whom the mistress called, "My little son," was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way.
The hen had very short legs, so she was called "Chickie short legs."
She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child.
In the morning, the strange visitor was discovered, and the tom cat began to purr, and the hen to cluck.
"What is that noise about?" said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home.
"Oh what a prize!" she exclaimed, "I hope it is not a drake, for then I shall have some duck's eggs.
I must wait and see."
So the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs.
Now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, "We and the world," for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too.
The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts.
"Can you lay eggs?" she asked.
"No."
"Then have the goodness to hold your tongue."
"Can you raise your back, or purr, or throw out sparks?" said the tom cat.
"No."
"Then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking."
So the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen.
"What an absurd idea," said the hen.
"You have nothing else to do, therefore you have foolish fancies.
If you could purr or lay eggs, they would pass away."
"But it is so delightful to swim about on the water," said the duckling, "and so refreshing to feel it close over your head, while you dive down to the bottom."
"Delightful, indeed!" said the hen, "why you must be crazy!
Ask the cat, he is the cleverest animal I know, ask him how he would like to swim about on the water, or to dive under it, for I will not speak of my own opinion; ask our mistress, the old woman- there is no one in the world more clever than she is.
Do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?"
"You don't understand me," said the duckling.
"We don't understand you?
Who can understand you, I wonder?
Do you consider yourself more clever than the cat, or the old woman?
I will say nothing of myself.
Don't imagine such nonsense, child, and thank your good fortune that you have been received here.
Are you not in a warm room, and in society from which you may learn something.
But you are a chatterer, and your company is not very agreeable.
Believe me, I speak only for your own good.
I may tell you unpleasant truths, but that is a proof of my friendship.
I advise you, therefore, to lay eggs, and learn to purr as quickly as possible."
"I believe I must go out into the world again," said the duckling.
"Yes, do," said the hen.
So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance.
Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold. then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air.
The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, "Croak, croak."
It made one shiver with cold to look at him.
All this was very sad for the poor little duckling.
One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes.
The duckling had never seen any like them before.
They were swans, and they curved their graceful necks, while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness.
They uttered a singular cry, as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea.
As they mounted higher and higher in the air, the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them.
He whirled himself in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards them, and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself.
Could he ever forget those beautiful, happy birds; and when at last they were out of his sight, he dived under the water, and rose again almost beside himself with excitement.
He knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world.
He was not envious of these beautiful creatures, but wished to be as lovely as they.
Poor ugly creature, how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement.
The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller.
At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up.
He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.
Early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened.
He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife.
The warmth revived the poor little creature; but when the children wanted to play with him, the duckling thought they would do him some harm; so he started up in terror, fluttered into the milk-pan, and splashed the milk about the room.
Then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more.
He flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again.
What a condition he was in!
The woman screamed, and struck at him with the tongs; the children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped.
The door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow.
It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes.
He felt the warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring.
Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air.
They bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before he well knew how it had happened.
The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn.
Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring.
From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming lightly over the smooth water.
The duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever.
"I will fly to those royal birds," he exclaimed, "and they will kill me, because I am so ugly, and dare to approach them; but it does not matter: better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks, beaten by the hens, pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry, or starved with hunger in the winter."
Then he flew to the water, and swam towards the beautiful swans.
The moment they espied the stranger, they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings.
"Kill me," said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death.
But what did he see in the clear stream below?
His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan.
To be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan's egg.
He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him; for the great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.
Into the garden presently came some little children, and threw bread and cake into the water.
"See," cried the youngest, "there is a new one;" and the rest were delighted, and ran to their father and mother, dancing and clapping their hands, and shouting joyously, "There is another swan come; a new one has arrived."
Then they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, "The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty."
And the old swans bowed their heads before him.
Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do, he was so happy, and yet not at all proud.
He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds.
Even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright.
Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, "I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling."
THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and mind were set upon conquering all the countries of the world, and on frightening the people; he devastated their countries with fire and sword, and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields and destroyed the peasants' huts by fire, so that the flames licked the green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung dried up on the singed black trees.
Many a poor mother fled, her naked baby in her arms, behind the still smoking walls of her cottage; but also there the soldiers followed her, and when they found her, she served as new nourishment to their diabolical enjoyments; demons could not possibly have done worse things than these soldiers!
The prince was of opinion that all this was right, and that it was only the natural course which things ought to take.
His power increased day by day, his name was feared by all, and fortune favoured his deeds.
He brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, and gradually accumulated in his residence riches which could nowhere be equalled.
He erected magnificent palaces, churches, and halls, and all who saw these splendid buildings and great treasures exclaimed admiringly: "What a mighty prince!"
But they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the destroyed cities.
The prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his magnificent edifices, and thought, like the crowd: "What a mighty prince!
But I must have more- much more.
No power on earth must equal mine, far less exceed it."
He made war with all his neighbours, and defeated them.
The conquered kings were chained up with golden fetters to his chariot when he drove through the streets of his city.
These kings had to kneel at his and his courtiers' feet when they sat at table, and live on the morsels which they left.
At last the prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches, on the altars, but in this the priests opposed him, saying: "Prince, you are mighty indeed, but God's power is much greater than yours; we dare not obey your orders."
"Well," said the prince.
"Then I will conquer God too."
And in his haughtiness and foolish presumption he ordered a magnificent ship to be constructed, with which he could sail through the air; it was gorgeously fitted out and of many colours; like the tail of a peacock, it was covered with thousands of eyes, but each eye was the barrel of a gun.
The prince sat in the centre of the ship, and had only to touch a spring in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in all directions, while the guns were at once loaded again.
Hundreds of eagles were attached to this ship, and it rose with the swiftness of an arrow up towards the sun.
The earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its mountains and woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made furrows which separated green meadows; soon it looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it; and at last it entirely disappeared in mist and clouds.
Higher and higher rose the eagles up into the air; then God sent one of his numberless angels against the ship.
The wicked prince showered thousands of bullets upon him, but they rebounded from his shining wings and fell down like ordinary hailstones.
One drop of blood, one single drop, came out of the white feathers of the angel's wings and fell upon the ship in which the prince sat, burnt into it, and weighed upon it like thousands of hundredweights, dragging it rapidly down to the earth again; the strong wings of the eagles gave way, the wind roared round the prince's head, and the clouds around- were they formed by the smoke rising up from the burnt cities?- took strange shapes, like crabs many, many miles long, which stretched their claws out after him, and rose up like enormous rocks, from which rolling masses dashed down, and became fire-spitting dragons.
The prince was lying half-dead in his ship, when it sank at last with a terrible shock into the branches of a large tree in the wood.
"I will conquer God!" said the prince.
"I have sworn it: my will must be done!"
And he spent seven years in the construction of wonderful ships to sail through the air, and had darts cast from the hardest steel to break the walls of heaven with.
He gathered warriors from all countries, so many that when they were placed side by side they covered the space of several miles.
They entered the ships and the prince was approaching his own, when God sent a swarm of gnats- one swarm of little gnats.
They buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats.
Then he ordered his servants to bring costly coverings and wrap him in them, that the gnats might no longer be able to reach him.
The servants carried out his orders, but one single gnat had placed itself inside one of the coverings, crept into the prince's ear and stung him.
The place burnt like fire, and the poison entered into his blood.
Mad with pain, he tore off the coverings and his clothes too, flinging them far away, and danced about before the eyes of his ferocious soldiers, who now mocked at him, the mad prince, who wished to make war with God, and was overcome by a single little gnat.
Once upon a time there was a village shop.
The name over the window was "Ginger and Pickles."
It was a little small shop just the right size for Dolls-- Lucinda and Jane Doll-cook always bought their groceries at Ginger and Pickles.
The counter inside was a convenient height for rabbits.
Ginger and Pickles sold red spotty pocket handkerchiefs at a penny three farthings.
They also sold sugar, and snuff and galoshes.
In fact, although it was such a small shop it sold nearly everything--except a few things that you want in a hurry--like bootlaces, hair- pins and mutton chops.
Ginger and Pickles were the people who kept the shop.
Ginger was a yellow tomcat, and Pickles was a terrier.
The rabbits were always a little bit afraid of Pickles.
The shop was also patronized by mice--only the mice were rather afraid of Ginger.
Ginger usually requested Pickles to serve them, because he said it made his mouth water.
"I cannot bear," said he, "to see them going out at the door carrying their little parcels."
"I have the same feeling about rats," replied Pickles, "but it would never do to eat our customers; they would leave us and go to Tabitha Twitchit's."
"On the contrary, they would go nowhere," replied Ginger gloomily.
(Tabitha Twitchit kept the only other shop in the village.
She did not give credit.)
But there is no money in what is called the "till."
Ginger and Pickles gave unlimited credit.
Now the meaning of "credit" is this--when a customer buys a bar of soap, instead of the customer pulling out a purse and paying for it --she says she will pay another time.
And Pickles makes a low bow and says, "With pleasure, madam," and it is written down in a book.
The customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of Ginger and Pickles.
The customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers.
But there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a penny- worth of peppermints.
But the sales were enormous, ten times as large as Tabitha Twitchit's.
As there was always no money, Ginger and Pickles were obliged to eat their own goods.
Pickles ate biscuits and Ginger ate a dried haddock.
They ate them by candle- light after the shop was closed.
"It is very uncomfortable, I am afraid I shall be summoned.
I have tried in vain to get a license upon credit at the Post Office;" said Pickles.
"The place is full of policemen.
I met one as I was coming home.
"Let us send in the bill again to Samuel Whiskers, Ginger, he owes 22/9 for bacon."
"I do not believe that he intends to pay at all," replied Ginger.
When it came to Jan. 1st there was still no money, and Pickles was unable to buy a dog license.
"It is very unpleasant, I am afraid of the police," said Pickles.
"It is your own fault for being a terrier; _I_ do not require a license, and neither does Kep, the Collie dog."
"And I feel sure that Anna Maria pockets things--
"Where are all the cream crackers?"
"You have eaten them yourself." replied Ginger.
Ginger and Pickles retired into the back parlor.
They did accounts.
They added up sums and sums, and sums.
"Samuel Whiskers has run up a bill as long as his tail; he has had an ounce and three- quarters of snuff since October.
"What is seven pounds of butter at 1/3, and a stick of sealing wax and four matches?"
"Send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,'" replied Ginger.
Pickles nearly had a fit, he barked and he barked and made little rushes.
"Bite him, Pickles! bite him!" spluttered Ginger behind a sugar barrel, "he's only a German doll!"
The policeman went on writing in his notebook; twice he put his pencil in his mouth, and once he dipped it in the treacle.
Pickles barked till he was hoarse.
But still the policeman took no notice.
He had bead eyes, and his helmet was sewed on with stitches.
After a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door.
They came out of the back parlor.
There was an envelope lying on the counter, and a policeman writing in a notebook!
At length on his last little rush--Pickles found that the shop was empty.
The policeman had disappeared.
But the envelope remained.
"Do you think that he has gone to fetch a real live policeman?
I am afraid it is a summons," said Pickles.
"No," replied Ginger, who had opened the envelope, "it is the rates and taxes, 3 pounds 19 11 3/4." [pounds are British money, the 19 is schillings, and then pence]
"This is the last straw," said Pickles, "let us close the shop."
They put up the shutters, and left.
But they have not removed from the neighborhood.
In fact some people wish they had gone further.
Ginger is living in the warren [game preserve for rabbits].
I do not know what occupation he pursues; he looks stout and comfortable.
Pickles is at present a game- keeper.
After a time Mr. John Dormouse and his daughter began to sell peppermints and candles.
But they did not keep "self- fitting sixes"; and it takes five mice to carry one seven inch candle.
The closing of the shop caused great inconvenience.
Tabitha Twitchit immediately raised the price of everything a halfpenny; and she continued to refuse to give credit.
Of course there are the tradesmen's carts--the butcher, the fishman and Timothy Baker.
But a person cannot live on "seed wigs" and sponge cake and butter buns--not even when the sponge cake is as good as Timothy's!
And Miss Dormouse refused to take back the ends when they were brought back to her with complaints.
And when Mr. John Dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but "very snug;" which is not the way to carry on a retail business.
Besides--the candles which they sell behave very strangely in warm weather.
So everybody was pleased when Sally Henny Penny sent out a printed poster to say that she was going to reopen the shop--"Henny's Opening Sale!
Grand cooperative Jumble!
Penny's penny prices!
Come buy, come try, come buy!"
The poster really was most 'ticing.
There was a rush upon the opening day.
The shop was crammed with customers, and there were crowds of mice upon the biscuit cannisters.
Sally Henny Penny gets rather flustered when she tries to count out change, and she insists on being paid cash; but she is quite harmless.
And she has laid in a remarkable assortment of bargains.
There is something to please everybody.
This is a Tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.
He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.
In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called Old Brown.
One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green-- Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.
They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to Owl Island to gather nuts.
Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.
They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.
Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--
"Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?"
But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners.
He bobbed up and down like a little red CHERRY, singing--
"Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!
A little wee man, in a red red coat!
A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat; If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat."
Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention whatever to Nutkin.
He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.
The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.
But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of Old Brown's doorway, and said--
"Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?"
But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old Mr. Brown with a NETTLE and singing--
"Old Mr. B!
Riddle-me-ree!
Hitty Pitty within the wall, Hitty Pitty without the wall; If you touch Hitty Pitty, Hitty Pitty will bite you!"
Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.
He shut the door in Nutkin's face.
Presently a little thread of blue SMOKE from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--
"A house full, a hole full!
And you cannot gather a bowl-full!"
The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.
But Nutkin gathered oak-apples-- yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.
On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.
They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl Island.
Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all.
He ran in front, singing--
"The man in the wilderness said to me, `How may strawberries grow in the sea?'
I answered him as I thought good-- `As many red herrings as grow in the wood."'
But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.
On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in PLUM-PUDDING for Old Brown.
Each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin.
But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever--
"Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree!
Flour of England, fruit of Spain, Met together in a shower of rain; Put in a bag tied round with a string, If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!"
Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to Old Brown.
The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle-pins.
On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone.
They had stolen it out of a bumble BEES' nest on the tippity top of the hill.
But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing--
"Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz!
Hum-a-bum buzz!
As I went over Tipple-tine I met a flock of bonny swine; Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!
They were the very bonniest swine That e'er went over the Tipple-tine."
Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.
But he ate up the honey!
The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.
But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.
On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid EGG in a little rush basket as a last parting present for Old Brown.
But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--
"Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck, With a white counterpane round his neck, Forty doctors and forty wrights, Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!"
Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again.
But still he did not speak.
Nutkin became more and more impertinent--
"Old Mr. B!
Old Mr. B!
Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door; All the King's horses, and all the King's men, Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore, Off the King's kitchen door!"
Nutkin danced up and down like a SUNBEAM; but still Old Brown said nothing at all.
Nutkin began again--
"Authur O'Bower has broken his band, He comes roaring up the land!
The King of Scots with all his power, Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!"
Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the WIND, and he took a running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!
. . .
Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud "Squeak!"
The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.
When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was Old Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.
* * * * * * * *
BUT NUTKIN WAS IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET!
This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.
Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase, and escaped out of the attic window.
And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--
"Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k!"
Pussy-cat sits by the fire--how should she be fair?
In walks the little dog--says "Pussy are you there?
How do you do Mistress Pussy?
Mistress Pussy, how do you do?"
"I thank you kindly, little dog, I fare as well as you!" [Old Rhyme]
Once upon a time there was a Pussy-cat called Ribby, who invited a little dog called Duchess to tea.
"Come in good time, my dear Duchess," said Ribby's letter, "and we will have something so very nice.
I am baking it in a pie-dish--a pie-dish with a pink rim.
You never tasted anything so good!
And YOU shall eat it all! _I_ will eat muffins, my dear Duchess!" wrote Ribby.
"I will come very punctually, my dear Ribby," wrote Duchess; and then at the end she added--"I hope it isn't mouse?"
And then she thought that did not look quite polite; so she scratched out "isn't mouse" and changed it to "I hope it will be fine," and she gave her letter to the postman.
But she thought a great deal about Ribby's pie, and she read Ribby's letter over and over again.
"I am dreadfully afraid it WILL be mouse!" said Duchess to herself--"I really couldn't, COULDN'T eat mouse pie.
And I shall have to eat it, because it is a party.
And MY pie was going to be veal and ham.
A pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like Ribby's dishes; they were both bought at Tabitha Twitchit's."
Duchess went into her larder and took the pie off a shelf and looked at it.
"Oh what a good idea!
Why shouldn't I rush along and put my pie into Ribby's oven when Ribby isn't there?"
Ribby in the meantime had received Duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come--she popped HER pie into the oven.
There were two ovens, one above the other; some other knobs and handles were only ornamental and not intended to open.
Ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff.
"The top oven bakes too quickly," said Ribby to herself.
Ribby put on some coal and swept up the hearth.
Then she went out with a can to the well, for water to fill up the kettle.
Then she began to set the room in order, for it was the sitting-room as well as the kitchen.
When Ribby had laid the table she went out down the field to the farm, to fetch milk and butter.
When she came back, she peeped into the bottom oven; the pie looked very comfortable.
Ribby put on her shawl and bonnet and went out again with a basket, to the village shop to buy a packet of tea, a pound of lump sugar, and a pot of marmalade.
And just at the same time, Duchess came out of HER house, at the other end of the village.
Ribby met Duchess half-way down the street, also carrying a basket, covered with a cloth.
They only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party.
As soon as Duchess had got round the corner out of sight--she simply ran!
Straight away to Ribby's house!
Ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with Cousin Tabitha Twitchit.
Ribby went on to Timothy Baker's and bought the muffins.
Then she went home.
There seemed to be a sort of scuffling noise in the back passage, as she was coming in at the front door.
But there was nobody there.
Duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door.
"It is a very odd thing that Ribby's pie was NOT in the oven when I put mine in!
And I can't find it anywhere; I have looked all over the house.
I put MY pie into a nice hot oven at the top.
I could not turn any of the other handles; I think that they are all shams," said Duchess, "but I wish I could have removed the pie made of mouse!
I cannot think what she has done with it?
I heard Ribby coming and I had to run out by the back door!"
Duchess went home and brushed her beautiful black coat; and then she picked a bunch of flowers in her garden as a present for Ribby; and passed the time until the clock struck four.
Ribby--having assured herself by careful search that there was really no one hiding in the cupboard or in the larder--went upstairs to change her dress.
She came downstairs again, and made the tea, and put the teapot on the hob.
She peeped again into the BOTTOM oven, the pie had become a lovely brown, and it was steaming hot.
She sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog.
"I am glad I used the BOTTOM oven," said Ribby, "the top one would certainly have been very much too hot."
Very punctually at four o'clock, Duchess started to go to the party.
At a quarter past four to the minute, there came a most genteel little tap-tappity.
"Is Mrs. Ribston at home?" inquired Duchess in the porch.
"Come in! and how do you do, my dear Duchess?" cried Ribby.
"I hope I see you well?"
"Quite well, I thank you, and how do YOU do, my dear Ribby?" said Duchess.
"I've brought you some flowers; what a delicious smell of pie!"
"Oh, what lovely flowers!
Yes, it is mouse and bacon!"
"I think it wants another five minutes," said Ribby.
"Just a shade longer; I will pour out the tea, while we wait.
Do you take sugar, my dear Duchess?"
"Oh yes, please! my dear Ribby; and may I have a lump upon my nose?"
"With pleasure, my dear Duchess."
Duchess sat up with the sugar on her nose and sniffed--
"How good that pie smells!
I do love veal and ham--I mean to say mouse and bacon--"
She dropped the sugar in confusion, and had to go hunting under the tea- table, so did not see which oven Ribby opened in order to get out the pie.
Ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell.
Duchess came out from under the table-cloth munching sugar, and sat up on a chair.
"I will first cut the pie for you; I am going to have muffin and marmalade," said Ribby.
"I think"--(thought Duchess to herself)--"I THINK it would be wiser if I helped myself to pie; though Ribby did not seem to notice anything when she was cutting it.
What very small fine pieces it has cooked into!
I did not remember that I had minced it up so fine; I suppose this is a quicker oven than my own."
The pie-dish was emptying rapidly!
Duchess had had four helps already, and was fumbling with the spoon.
"A little more bacon, my dear Duchess?" said Ribby.
"Thank you, my dear Ribby; I was only feeling for the patty-pan."
"The patty-pan? my dear Duchess?"
"The patty pan that held up the pie-crust," said Duchess, blushing under her black coat.
"Oh, I didn't put one in, my dear Duchess," said Ribby; "I don't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse."
Duchess fumbled with the spoon-- "I can't find it!" she said anxiously.
"There isn't a patty-pan," said Ribby, looking perplexed.
"Yes, indeed, my dear Ribby; where can it have gone to?" said Duchess.
Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish.
"I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard."
Duchess set up a howl.
"I shall die!
I shall die!
I have swallowed a patty-pan!
Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!"
"It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan."
"Yes there WAS, my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!"
"Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think you feel it?"
"Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my dear Ribby."
"Shall I run for the doctor?"
"Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he will certainly understand."
Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor.
She found him at the smithy.
Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.
Dr. Maggotty hopped so fast that Ribby had to run.
It was most conspicuous.
All the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.
But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor--a curious thing had happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.
"How COULD I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!"
She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate.
The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!
Duchess started!
She opened the door of the TOP oven;--out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,-- and through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!
Duchess drew a long breath--
"Then I must have been eating MOUSE!
. . .
No wonder I feel ill.
. . .
But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!"
Duchess reflected--"What a very awkward thing to have to explain to Ribby!
I think I will put MY pie in the back-yard and say nothing about it.
When I go home, I will run round and take it away."
She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.
"I am feeling very much better," said Duchess, waking up with a jump.
"I am truly glad to hear it!
He has brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!"
"I think I should feel QUITE well if he only felt my pulse," said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak.
"It is only a bread pill, you had much better take it; drink a little milk, my dear Duchess!"
"I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby," said Duchess.
"Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?"
"Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess."
Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home.
Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone in and shut her door.
Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.
Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws.
The jackdaws were eating piecrust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan.
Duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly!
When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things, she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard.
Ribby stared with amazement-- "Did you ever see the like! so there really WAS a patty-pan?
. . .
But MY patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard.
Well I never did!
. . .
Next time I want to give a party--I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!"
Once upon a time there was an old cat, called Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit, who was an anxious parent.
She used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief!
On baking day she determined to shut them up in a cupboard.
She caught Moppet and Mittens, but she could not find Tom.
Mrs. Tabitha went up and down all over the house, mewing for Tom Kitten.
She looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets.
She went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere.
It was an old, old house, full of cupboards and passages.
Some of the walls were four feet thick, and there used to be queer noises inside them, as if there might be a little secret staircase.
Certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night-- especially cheese and bacon.
Mrs. Tabitha became more and more distracted and mewed dreadfully.
While their mother was searching the house, Moppet and Mittens had got into mischief.
The cupboard door was not locked, so they pushed it open and came out.
They went straight to the dough which was set to rise in a pan before the fire.
They patted it with their little soft paws--"Shall we make dear little muffins?" said Mittens to Moppet.
But just at that moment somebody knocked at the front door, and Moppet jumped into the flour barrel in a fright.
Mittens ran away to the dairy and hid in an empty jar on the stone shelf where the milk pans stand.
The visitor was a neighbor, Mrs. Ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast.
Mr. Tabitha came downstairs mewing dreadfully--"Come in, Cousin Ribby, come in, and sit ye down!
I'm in sad trouble, Cousin Ribby," said Tabitha, shedding tears.
"I've lost my dear son Thomas; I'm afraid the rats have got him."
She wiped her eyes with her apron.
"He's a bad kitten, Cousin Tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time I came to tea.
Where have you looked for him?"
"All over the house!
The rats are too many for me.
What a thing it is to have an unruly family!" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.
"I'm not afraid of rats; I will help you to find him; and whip him, too!
What is all that soot in the fender?"
"The chimney wants sweeping-- Oh, dear me, Cousin Ribby--now Moppet and Mittens are gone!
"They have both got out of the cupboard!"
Ribby and Tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again.
They poked under the beds with Ribby's umbrella and they rummaged in cupboards.
They even fetched a candle and looked inside a clothes chest in one of the attics.
They could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs.
"Yes, it is infested with rats," said Tabitha tearfully.
"I caught seven young ones out of one hole in the back kitchen, and we had them for dinner last Saturday.
And once I saw the old father rat--an enormous old rat-- Cousin Ribby.
I was just going to jump upon him, when he showed his yellow teeth at me and whisked down the hole.
"The rats get upon my nerves, Cousin Ribby," said Tabitha.
Ribby and Tabitha searched and searched.
They both heard a curious roly-poly noise under the attic floor.
But there was nothing to be seen.
They returned to the kitchen.
"Here's one of your kittens at least," said Ribby, dragging Moppet out of the flour barrel.
They shook the flour off her and set her down on the kitchen floor.
She seemed to be in a terrible fright.
"Oh!
Mother, Mother," said Moppet, "there's been an old woman rat in the kitchen, and she's stolen some of the dough!"
The two cats ran to look at the dough pan.
Sure enough there were marks of little scratching fingers, and a lump of dough was gone!
"Which way did she go, Moppet?"
But Moppet had been too much frightened to peep out of the barrel again.
Ribby and Tabitha took her with them to keep her safely in sight, while they went on with their search.
They went into the dairy.
The first thing they found was Mittens, hiding in an empty jar.
They tipped over the jar, and she scrambled out.
"Oh, Mother, Mother!" said Mittens--
"Oh!
Mother, Mother, there has been an old man rat in the dairy--a dreadful 'normous big rat, Mother; and he's stolen a pat of butter and the rolling pin."
Ribby and Tabitha looked at one another.
"A rolling pin and butter!
Oh, my poor son Thomas!" exclaimed Tabitha, wringing her paws.
"A rolling pin?" said Ribby.
"Did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest?"
Ribby and Tabitha rushed upstairs again.
Sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor.
"This is serious, Cousin Tabitha," said Ribby.
"We must send for John Joiner at once, with a saw."
Now, this is what had been happening to Tom Kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats.
Tom Kitten did not want to be shut up in a cupboard.
When he saw that his mother was going to bake, he determined to hide.
He looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney.
The fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks.
Tom Kitten got upon the fender and looked up.
It was a big old- fashioned fireplace.
The chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about.
So there was plenty of room for a little Tom Cat.
He jumped right up into the fireplace, balancing himself upon the iron bar where the kettle hangs.
Tom Kitten took another big jump off the bar and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender.
Tom Kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below.
He made up his mind to climb right to the top, and get out on the slates, and try to catch sparrows.
"I cannot go back.
If I slipped I might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket."
The chimney was a very big old- fashioned one.
It was built in the days when people burnt logs of wood upon the hearth.
The chimney stack stood up above the roof like a little stone tower, and the daylight shone down from the top, under the slanting slates that kept out the rain.
Tom Kitten was getting very frightened!
He climbed up, and up, and up.
Then he waded sideways through inches of soot.
He was like a little sweep himself.
It was most confusing in the dark.
One flue seemed to lead into another.
There was less smoke, but Tom Kitten felt quite lost.
He scrambled up and up; but before he reached the chimney top he came to a place where somebody had loosened a stone in the wall.
There were some mutton bones lying about.
"This seems funny," said Tom Kitten.
"Who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney?
I wish I had never come!
And what a funny smell?
It is something like mouse, only dreadfully strong.
It makes me sneeze," said Tom Kitten.
He squeezed through the hole in the wall and dragged himself along a most uncomfortably tight passage where there was scarcely any light.
He groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture.
All at once he fell head over heels in the dark, down a hole, and landed on a heap of very dirty rags.
When Tom Kitten picked himself up and looked about him, he found himself in a place that he had never seen before, although he had lived all his life in the house.
It was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster.
Opposite to him--as far away as he could sit--was an enormous rat.
"What do you mean by tumbling into my bed all covered with smuts?" said the rat, chattering his teeth.
"Please, sir, the chimney wants sweeping," said poor Tom Kitten.
"Anna Maria!
Anna Maria!" squeaked the rat.
There was a pattering noise and an old woman rat poked her head round a rafter.
All in a minute she rushed upon Tom Kitten, and before he knew what was happening.
. .
. . . his coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots.
Anna Maria did the tying.
The old rat watched her and took snuff.
When she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open.
"Anna Maria," said the old man rat (whose name was Samuel Whiskers), "Anna Maria, make me a kitten dumpling roly-poly pudding for my dinner."
"It requires dough and a pat of butter and a rolling pin," said Anna Maria, considering Tom Kitten with her head on one side.
"No," said Samuel Whiskers, "make it properly, Anna Maria, with breadcrumbs."
"Nonsense!
Butter and dough," replied Anna Maria.
The two rats consulted together for a few minutes and then went away.
Samuel Whiskers got through a hole in the wainscot and went boldly down the front staircase to the dairy to get the butter.
He did not meet anybody.
He made a second journey for the rolling pin.
He pushed it in front of him with his paws, like a brewer's man trundling a barrel.
He could hear Ribby and Tabitha talking, but they were too busy lighting the candle to look into the chest.
They did not see him.
Anna Maria went down by way of skirting board and a window shutter to the kitchen to steal the dough.
She borrowed a small saucer and scooped up the dough with her paws.
She did not observe Moppet.
While Tom Kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help.
But his mouth was full of soot and cobwebs, and he was tied up in such very tight knots, he could not make anybody hear him.
Except a spider who came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance.
It was a judge of knots because it had a habit of tying up unfortunate bluebottles.
It did not offer to assist him.
Tom Kitten wriggled and squirmed until he was quite exhausted.
Presently the rats came back and set to work to make him into a dumpling.
First they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough.
"Will not the string be very indigestible, Anna Maria?" inquired Samuel Whiskers.
Anna Maria said she thought that it was of no consequence; but she wished that Tom Kitten would hold his head still, as it disarranged the pastry.
She laid hold of his ears.
Tom Kitten bit and spit, and mewed and wriggled; and the rolling pin went roly-poly, roly; roly-poly, roly.
The rats each held an end.
"His tail is sticking out!
You did not fetch enough dough, Anna Maria."
"I fetched as much as I could carry," replied Anna Maria.
"I do not think"--said Samuel Whiskers, pausing to take a look at Tom Kitten--"I do NOT think it will be a good pudding.
It smells sooty."
Anna Maria was about to argue the point when all at once there began to be other sounds up above--the rasping noise of a saw, and the noise of a little dog, scratching and yelping!
The rats dropped the rolling pin and listened attentively.
"We are discovered and interrupted, Anna Maria; let us collect our property--and other people's--and depart at once.
"I fear that we shall be obliged to leave this pudding.
"But I am persuaded that the knots would have proved indigestible, whatever you may urge to the contrary."
"Come away at once and help me to tie up some mutton bones in a counterpane," said Anna Maria.
"I have got half a smoked ham hidden in the chimney."
So it happened that by the time John Joiner had got the plank up-- there was nobody here under the floor except the rolling pin and Tom Kitten in a very dirty dumpling!
But there was a strong smell of rats; and John Joiner spent the rest of the morning sniffing and whining, and wagging his tail, and going round and round with his head in the hole like a gimlet.
Then he nailed the plank down again and put his tools in his bag, and came downstairs.
The cat family had quite recovered.
They invited him to stay to dinner.
The dumpling had been peeled off Tom Kitten and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts.
They had been obliged to put Tom Kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off.
John Joiner smelt the pudding; but he regretted that he had not time to stay to dinner, because he had just finished making a wheelbarrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen coops.
And when I was going to the post late in the afternoon--I looked up the land from the corner, and I saw Mr. Samuel Whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow, which looked very much like mine.
They were just turning in at the gate to the barn of Farmer Potatoes.
Samuel Whiskers was puffing and out of breath.
Anna Maria was still arguing in shrill tones.
She seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage.
I am sure _I_ never gave her leave to borrow my wheelbarrow!
They went into the barn and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow.
After that, there were no more rats for a long time at Tabitha Twitchit's.
As for Farmer Potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted.
There are rats, and rats, and rats in his barn!
They eat up the chicken food, and steal the oats and bran, and make holes in the meal bags.
And they are all descended from Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Whiskers-- children and grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.
There is no end to them!
Moppet and Mittens have grown up into very good rat-catchers.
They go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment.
They charge so much a dozen and earn their living very comfortably.
They hang up the rats' tails in a row on the barn door, to show how many they have caught--dozens and dozens of them.
But Tom Kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than--
A Mouse.
This is a fierce bad Rabbit; look at his savage whiskers and his claws and his turned-up tail.
This is a nice gentle Rabbit.
His mother has given him a carrot.
The bad Rabbit would like some carrot.
He doesn't say "Please."
He takes it!
And he scratches the good Rabbit very badly.
The good Rabbit creeps away and hides in a hole.
It feels sad.
This is a man with a gun.
He sees something sitting on a bench.
He thinks it is a very funny bird!
He comes creeping up behind the trees.
And then he shoots--BANG!
This is what happens--
But this is all he finds on the bench when he rushes up with his gun.
The good Rabbit peeps out of its hole . . .
. . . and it sees the bad Rabbit tearing past--without any tail or whiskers!
This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet; she thinks she has heard a mouse!
This is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard and making fun of Miss Moppet.
He is not afraid of a kitten.
This is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head.
She thinks it is a very hard cupboard!
The Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.
Miss Moppet ties up her head in a duster and sits before the fire.
The Mouse thinks she is looking very ill.
He comes sliding down the bellpull.
Miss Moppet looks worse and worse.
The Mouse comes a little nearer.
Miss Moppet holds her poor head in her paws and looks at him through a hole in the duster.
The Mouse comes VERY close.
And then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!
And because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet--Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse, which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet.
She ties him up in the duster and tosses it about like a ball.
But she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it-- there was no Mouse!
He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on top of the cupboard!
"I'll be at charges for a looking-glass; And entertain a score or two of tailors." [Richard III]
My Dear Freda:
Because you are fond of fairytales, and have been ill, I have made you a story all for yourself--a new one that nobody has read before.
And the queerest thing about it is--that I heard it in Gloucestershire, and that it is true--at least about the tailor, the waistcoat, and the "No more twist!" _Christmas_
In the time of swords and peri wigs and full-skirted coats with flowered lappets--when gentlemen wore ruffles, and gold-laced waistcoats of paduasoy and taffeta--there lived a tailor in Gloucester.
He sat in the window of a little shop in Westgate Street, cross-legged on a table from morning till dark.
All day long while the light lasted he sewed and snippetted, piecing out his satin, and pompadour, and lutestring; stuffs had strange names, and were very expensive in the days of the Tailor of Gloucester.
But although he sewed fine silk for his neighbours, he himself was very, very poor.
He cut his coats without waste; according to his embroidered cloth, they were very small ends and snippets that lay about upon the table--"Too narrow breadths for nought--except waistcoats for mice," said the tailor.
One bitter cold day near Christmastime the tailor began to make a coat (a coat of cherry- coloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses) and a cream- coloured satin waistcoat for the Mayor of Gloucester.
The tailor worked and worked, and he talked to himself: "No breadth at all, and cut on the cross; it is no breadth at all; tippets for mice and ribbons for mobs! for mice!" said the Tailor of Gloucester.
When the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window- panes and shut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and satin lay cut out upon the table.
There were twelve pieces for the coat and four pieces for the waistcoat; and there were pocket-flaps and cuffs and buttons, all in order.
For the lining of the coat there was fine yellow taffeta, and for the button- holes of the waistcoat there was cherry-coloured twist.
And everything was ready to sew together in the morning, all measured and sufficient--except that there was wanting just one single skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk.
The tailor came out of his shop at dark.
No one lived there at nights but little brown mice, and THEY ran in and out without any keys!
For behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in Gloucester, there are little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from house to house through those long, narrow passages.
But the tailor came out of his shop and shuffled home through the snow.
And although it was not a big house, the tailor was so poor he only rented the kitchen.
He lived alone with his cat; it was called Simpkin.
"Miaw?" said the cat when the tailor opened the door, "miaw?"
The tailor replied: "Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to a ravelling.
Take this groat (which is our last fourpence), and, Simpkin, take a china pipkin, but a penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of milk, and a penn'orth of sausages.
And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our fourpence but me one penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk.
But do not lose the last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a thread-paper, for I have NO MORE TWIST."
Then Simpkin again said "Miaw!" and took the groat and the pipkin, and went out into the dark.
The tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill.
He sat down by the hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.
"I shall make my fortune--to be cut bias--the Mayor of Gloucester is to be married on Christmas Day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an embroidered waistcoat--"
Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--
Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!
"Now what can that be?" said the Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from his chair.
The tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser, listening, and peering through his spectacles.
"This is very peculiar," said the Tailor of Gloucester, and he lifted up the tea-cup which was upside down.
Out stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a courtesy to the tailor!
Then she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the wainscot.
The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands.
But all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises--
Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!
"This is passing extraordinary!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down.
Out stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!
And out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other and more little mice, who hopped away down off the dresser and under the wainscot.
The tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting: "One-and-twenty buttonholes of cherry-coloured silk!
To be finished by noon of Saturday: and this is Tuesday evening.
Was it right to let loose those mice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin?
Alack, I am undone, for I have no more twist!"
The little mice came out again and listened to the tailor; they took notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat.
They whispered to one another about the taffeta lining and about little mouse tippets.
And then suddenly they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another as they ran from house to house.
Not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin came back.
He set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups.
He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!
"Simpkin," said the tailor, "where is my TWIST?"
But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked: "Where is my MOUSE?"
"Alack, I am undone!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to bed.
All that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen, peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!
The poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled: "No more twist! no more twist!"
What should become of the cherry- coloured coat?
Who should come to sew it, when the window was barred, and the door was fast locked?
Out-of-doors the market folks went trudging through the snow to buy their geese and turkeys, and to bake their Christmas pies; but there would be no dinner for Simpkin and the poor old tailor of Gloucester.
The tailor lay ill for three days and nights; and then it was Christmas Eve, and very late at night.
And still Simpkin wanted his mice, and mewed as he stood beside the four-post bed.
But it is in the old story that all the beasts can talk in the night between Christmas Eve and Christmas Day in the morning (though there are very few folk that can hear them, or know what it is that they say).
When the Cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer--like an echo of the chimes--and Simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door, and wandered about in the snow.
From all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in Gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old Christmas rhymes--all the old songs that ever I heard of, and some that I don't know, like Whittington's bells.
Under the wooden eaves the starlings and sparrows sang of Christmas pies; the jackdaws woke up in the Cathedral tower; and although it was the middle of the night the throstles and robins sang; and air was quite full of little twittering tunes.
But it was all rather provoking to poor hungry Simpkin.
From the tailor's ship in Westgate came a glow of light; and when Simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles.
There was a snippeting of scissors, and snappeting of thread; and little mouse voices sang loudly and gaily:
"Four-and-twenty tailors Went to catch a snail, The best man amongst them Durst not touch her tail; She put out her horns Like a little kyloe cow.
Run, tailors, run!
Or she'll have you all e'en now!"
Then without a pause the little mouse voices went on again:
"Sieve my lady's oatmeal, Grind my lady's flour, Put it in a chestnut, Let it stand an hour--"
"Mew!
Mew!" interrupted Simpkin, and he scratched at the door.
But the key was under the tailor's pillow; he could not get in.
The little mice only laughed, and tried another tune--
"Three little mice sat down to spin, Pussy passed by and she peeped in.
What are you at, my fine little men?
Making coats for gentlemen.
Shall I come in and cut off yours threads?
Oh, no, Miss Pussy, You'd bite off our heads!"
"Mew! scratch! scratch!" scuffled Simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout all at once in little twittering voices: "No more twist!
No more twist!"
And they barred up the window-shutters and shut out Simpkin.
Simpkin came away from the shop and went home considering in his mind.
He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.
Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the tea-pot; and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of his badness compared with those good little mice!
When the tailor awoke in the morning, the first thing which he saw, upon the patchwork quilt, was a skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and beside his bed stood the repentant Simpkin!
The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.
"Alack," said the tailor, "I have my twist; but no more strength--nor time--than will serve to make me one single buttonhole; for this is Christmas Day in the Morning!
The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by noon--and where is his cherry- coloured coat?"
He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin ran in, like a cat that expects something.
But there was no one there!
Not even one little brown mouse!
But upon the table--oh joy! the tailor gave a shout--there, where he had left plain cuttings of silk--there lay the most beautiful coat and embroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester!
Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured buttonhole, and where that buttonhole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words--in little teeny weeny writing--
NO MORE TWIST.
And from then began the luck of the Tailor of Gloucester; he grew quite stout, and he grew quite rich.
He made the most wonderful waistcoats for all the rich merchants of Gloucester, and for all the fine gentlemen of the country round.
Never were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets!
But his buttonholes were the greatest triumph of it all.
The stitches of those buttonholes were so neat--SO neat--I wonder how they could be stitched by an old man in spectacles, with crooked old fingers, and a tailor's thimble.
The stitches of those buttonholes were so small--SO small--they looked as if they had been made by little mice!
One morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.
He pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.
A gig was coming along the road; it was driven by Mr. McGregor, and beside him sat Mrs. McGregor in her best bonnet.
As soon as they had passed, little Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of Mr. McGregor's garden.
That wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins--Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.
Old Mrs. Rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (I once bought a pair at a bazaar).
She also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).
Little Benjamin did not very much want to see his Aunt.
He came round the back of the fir- tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his Cousin Peter.
Peter was sitting by himself.
He looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.
"Peter," said little Benjamin, in a whisper, "who has got your clothes?"
Peter replied, "The scarecrow in Mr. McGregor's garden," and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.
Little Benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that Mr. McGregor had gone out in a gig, and Mrs. McGregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.
Peter said he hoped that it would rain.
At this point old Mrs. Rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: "Cotton-tail!
Cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!"
Peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.
They went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood.
From here they looked down into Mr. McGregor's garden.
Peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of Mr. McGregor's.
Little Benjamin said: "It spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree."
Peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.
It had been sown with lettuces.
They left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little Benjamin, who was wearing clogs.
Little Benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back Peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket- handkerchief.
They took them off the scarecrow.
There had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.
Benjamin tried on the tam-o'- shanter, but it was too big for him.
Then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his Aunt.
Peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.
Benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf.
He said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their Sunday dinner.
(The name of little Benjamin's papa was old Mr. Benjamin Bunny.)
The lettuces certainly were very fine.
Peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home.
Presently he dropped half the onions.
Little Benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables.
He led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden.
They went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.
The mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin Bunny.
Presently Peter let the pocket- handkerchief go again.
They got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs.
Peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!
He was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.
This is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!
Little Benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and Peter and the onions underneath a large basket.
. . .
The cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.
Perhaps she liked the smell of onions!
Anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.
She sat there for FIVE HOURS.
I cannot draw you a picture of Peter and Benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made Peter Rabbit and little Benjamin cry.
The sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.
At length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.
The cat looked up and saw old Mr. Benjamin Bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.
He was smoking a pipe of rabbit- tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.
He was looking for his son.
Old Mr. Bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.
He took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.
The cat was too much surprised to scratch back.
When old Mr. Bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.
Then he came back to the basket and took out his son Benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.
Then he took out his nephew Peter.
Then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.
When Mr. McGregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.
It looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!
Also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up INSIDE the greenhouse, locking the door upon the OUTSIDE.
When Peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat.
Cotton-tail and Peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old Mrs. Rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit- tobacco.
What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!
Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.
Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to someone else-- "I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima.
You would let them go cold; you know you would!"
"I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself," quacked Jemima Puddle-duck.
She tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.
Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate.
She determined to make a nest right away from the farm.
She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart road that leads over the hill.
She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.
When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.
She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.
Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying.
She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.
She flew beautifully when she had got a good start.
She skimmed along over the treetops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.
Jemima alighted rather heavily and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting place.
She rather fancied a tree stump amongst some tall foxgloves.
But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.
He had black prick ears and sandy colored whiskers.
"Quack?" said Jemima Puddle- duck, with her head and her bonnet on the one side--"Quack?"
The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima--
"Madam, have you lost your way?" said he.
He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.
Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome.
She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting place.
"Ah! is that so?
Indeed!" said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at Jemima.
He folded up the newspaper and put it in his coattail pocket.
Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.
"Indeed!
How interesting!
I wish I could meet with that fowl.
I would teach it to mind its own business!
"But as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my woodshed.
No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way.
You may sit there as long as you like," said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.
He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the foxgloves.
It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.
"This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient," said the hospitable gentleman.
There was a tumbledown shed at the back of the house, made of old soap boxes.
The gentleman opened the door and showed Jemima in.
The shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.
Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers.
But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.
When she came out, the sandy- whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.
He was so polite that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for the night.
He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again the next day.
He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his woodshed.
Jemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest.
They were greeny white and very large.
The foxy gentleman admired them immensely.
He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not there.
At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--"and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched.
They might catch cold," said the conscientious Jemima.
"Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats.
But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat.
Let us have a dinner party all to ourselves!
"May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm garden to make a savory omelet?
Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley.
I will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelet," said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.
Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.
She went round the farm garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.
And she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket.
The collie dog Kep met her coming out, "What are you doing with those onions?
Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?"
Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.
The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.
He asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed.
Then he went out, and trotted down the village.
He went to look for two foxhound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.
Jemima Puddle-duck went up the cart road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon.
She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.
She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.
He was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air and kept glancing uneasily round the wood.
When Jemima alighted he quite jumped.
"Come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs.
Give me the herbs for the omelet.
Be sharp!"
He was rather abrupt.
Jemima Puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.
She felt surprised and uncomfortable.
While she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed.
Someone with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and them locked it.
Jemima became much alarmed.
A moment afterward there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans.
And nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.
Presently Kep opened the door of the shed and let out Jemima Puddle- duck.
Unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.
He had a bite on his ear, and both the puppies were limping.
Jemima Puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.
She laid some more in June, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched.
Jemima Puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter.
Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.
The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.
But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!
He was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond--
"I will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
"If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton.
The Alderman, however, eats salad."
Mr. Jeremy put on a mackintosh, and a pair of shiny galoshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.
The boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves.
It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.
Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water.
"I know a good place for minnows," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened the boat to it.
Then he settled himself cross- legged and arranged his fishing tackle.
He had the dearest little red float.
His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.
The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.
"This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.
"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
A great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his galoshes.
Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.
Once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.
"I trust that is not a rat," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; "I think I had better get away from here."
Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait.
There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!
"A minnow! a minnow!
I have him by the nose!" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod.
But what a horrible surprise!
Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp, the stickleback, covered with spines!
The stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath.
Then he jumped back into the water.
And a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
And while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a MUCH worse thing happened; a really FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a mackintosh!
A great big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash-- and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, "Ow!
Ow!
Ow!"--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!
But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the mackintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's galoshes.
Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond.
He scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his mackintosh all in tatters.
"What a mercy that was not a pike!" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.
"I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!"
He put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner.
He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.
Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat.
And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.
And instead of a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_ think it must have been nasty!
I have made many books about well-behaved people.
Now, for a change, I am going to make a story about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.
Nobody could call Mr. Tod "nice."
The rabbits could not bear him; they could smell him half a mile off.
He was of a wandering habit and he had foxy whiskers; they never knew where he would be next.
One day he was living in a stick- house in the coppice [grove], causing terror to the family of old Mr. Benjamin Bouncer.
Next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats.
In winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of Bull Banks, under Oatmeal Crag.
He had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home.
The houses were not always empty when Mr. Tod moved OUT; because sometimes Tommy Brock moved IN; (without asking leave).
Tommy Brock was a short bristly fat waddling person with a grin; he grinned all over his face.
He was not nice in his habits.
He ate wasp nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging things up.
His clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the daytime, he always went to bed in his boots.
And the bed which he went to bed in was generally Mr. Tod's.
Now Tommy Brock did occasionally eat rabbit pie; but it was only very little young ones occasionally, when other food was really scarce.
He was friendly with old Mr. Bouncer; they agreed in disliking the wicked otters and Mr. Tod; they often talked over that painful subject.
Old Mr. Bouncer was stricken in years.
He sat in the spring sunshine outside the burrow, in a muffler; smoking a pipe of rabbit tobacco.
He lived with his son Benjamin Bunny and his daughter-in-law Flopsy, who had a young family.
Old Mr. Bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon, because Benjamin and Flopsy had gone out.
The little rabbit babies were just old enough to open their blue eyes and kick.
They lay in a fluffy bed of rabbit wool and hay, in a shallow burrow, separate from the main rabbit hole.
To tell the truth--old Mr. Bouncer had forgotten them.
He sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with Tommy Brock, who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging, and some mole traps.
He complained bitterly about the scarcity of pheasants' eggs, and accused Mr. Tod of poaching them.
And the otters had cleared off all the frogs while he was asleep in winter--"I have not had a good square meal for a fort- night, I am living on pig-nuts.
I shall have to turn vegetarian and eat my own tail!" said Tommy Brock.
It was not much of a joke, but it tickled old Mr. Bouncer; because Tommy Brock was so fat and stumpy and grinning.
So old Mr. Bouncer laughed; and pressed Tommy Brock to come inside, to taste a slice of seed cake and "a glass of my daughter Flopsy's cowslip wine."
Tommy Brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity.
Then old Mr. Bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave Tommy Brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made Tommy Brock grin more than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow.
Old Mr. Bouncer coughed and laughed; and Tommy Brock puffed and grinned.
And Mr. Bouncer laughed and coughed, and shut his eyes because of the cabbage smoke ..........
When Flopsy and Benjamin came back old Mr. Bouncer woke up.
Tommy Brock and all the young rabbit babies had disappeared!
Mr. Bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole.
But the smell of badger was undeniable; and there were round heavy footmarks in the sand.
He was in disgrace; Flopsy wrung her ears, and slapped him.
Benjamin Bunny set off at once after Tommy Brock.
There was not much difficulty in tracking him; he had left his foot- mark and gone slowly up the winding footpath through the wood.
Here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel.
There he had dug quite a deep hole for dog darnel; and had set a mole trap.
A little stream crossed the way.
Benjamin skipped lightly over dry-foot; the badger's heavy steps showed plainly in the mud.
The path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared; there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths --but the smell that made Benjamin stop was NOT the smell of flowers!
Mr. Tod's stick house was before him; and, for once, Mr. Tod was at home.
There was not only a foxy flavor in proof of it--there was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney.
Benjamin Bunny sat up, staring, his whiskers twitched.
Inside the stick house somebody dropped a plate, and said something.
Benjamin stamped his foot, and bolted.
He never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood.
Apparently Tommy Brock had turned the same way.
Upon the top of the wall there were again the marks of
badger; and some ravellings of a sack had caught on a briar.
Benjamin climbed over the wall, into a meadow.
He found another mole trap newly set; he was still upon the track of Tommy Brock.
It was getting late in the afternoon.
Other rabbits were coming out to enjoy the evening air.
One of them in a blue coat, by himself, was busily hunting for dandelions.-- "Cousin Peter!
Peter Rabbit, Peter Rabbit!" shouted Benjamin Bunny.
The blue coated rabbit sat up with pricked ears--"Whatever is the matter, Cousin Benjamin?
Is it a cat? or John Stoat Ferret?"
"No, no, no!
He's bagged my family--Tommy Brock--in a sack --have you seen him?"
"Tommy Brock? how many, Cousin Benjamin?"
"Seven, Cousin Peter, and all of them twins!
Did he come this way?
Please tell me quick!"
"Yes, yes; not ten minutes since ... he said they were CATERPILLARS; I did think they were kicking rather hard, for caterpillars."
"Which way? which way has he gone, Cousin Peter?"
"He had a sack with something live in it; I watched him set a mole trap.
Let me use my mind, Cousin Benjamin; tell me from the beginning," Benjamin did so.
"My Uncle Bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years;" said Peter reflectively, "but there are two hopeful circumstances.
Your family is alive and kicking; and Tommy Brock has had refreshments.
He will probably go to sleep, and keep them for breakfast."
"Which way?"
"Cousin Benjamin, compose yourself.
I know very well which way.
Because Mr. Tod was at home in the stick house he has gone to Mr. Tod's other house, at the top of Bull Banks.
I partly know, because he offered to leave any message at Sister Cottontail's; he said he would be passing."
(Cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on the hill.)
Peter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was all of atwitter.
They crossed several fields and began to climb the hill; the tracks of Tommy Brock were plainly to be seen.
He seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest.
"He must be very puffed; we are close behind him, by the scent.
What a nasty person!" said Peter.
The sunshine was still warm and slanting on the hill pastures.
Half way up, Cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half- grown little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown.
Cottontail had seen Tommy Brock passing in the distance.
Asked whether her husband was at home she replied that Tommy Brock had rested twice while she watched him.
He had nodded, and pointed to the sack, and seemed doubled up with laughing.--"Come away, Peter; he will be cooking them; come quicker!" said Benjamin Bunny.
They climbed up and up;--"He was at home; I saw his black ears peeping out of the hole."
"They live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbors.
Come on, Cousin Benjamin!"
When they came near the wood at the top of Bull Banks, they went cautiously.
The trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a crag, Mr. Tod had made one of his homes.
It was at the top of a steep bank; the rocks and bushes overhung it.
The rabbits crept up carefully, listening and peeping.
This house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumbledown pigsty.
There was a strong door, which was shut and locked.
The setting sun made the window panes glow like red flame; but the kitchen fire was not alight.
It was neatly laid with dry sticks, as the rabbits could see, when they peeped through the window.
Benjamin sighed with relief.
But there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder.
There was an immense empty pie dish of blue willow pattern, and a large carving knife and fork, and a chopper.
At the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt cellar, mustard and a chair-- in short, preparations for one person's supper.
No person was to be seen, and no young rabbits.
The kitchen was empty and silent; the clock had run down.
Peter and Benjamin flattened their noses against the window, and stared into the dusk.
Then they scrambled round the rocks to the other side of the house.
It was damp and smelly, and over- grown with thorns and briars.
The rabbits shivered in their shoes.
"Oh my poor rabbit babies!
What a dreadful place; I shall never see them again!" sighed Benjamin.
They crept up to the bedroom window.
It was closed and bolted like the kitchen.
But there were signs that this window had been recently open; the cobwebs were disturbed, and there were fresh dirty footmarks upon the windowsill.
The room inside was so dark that at first they could make out nothing; but they could hear a noise--a slow deep regular snoring grunt.
And as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they perceived that somebody was asleep on Mr. Tod's bed, curled up under the blanket.--"He has gone to bed in his boots," whispered Peter.
Benjamin, who was all of atwitter, pulled Peter off the windowsill.
Tommy Brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from Mr. Tod's bed.
Nothing could be seen of the young family.
The sun had set; an owl began to hoot in the wood.
There were many unpleasant things lying about that had much better have been buried; rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors.
It was a shocking place, and very dark.
They went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window.
They tried to push up a rusty nail between the window sashes; but it was of no use, especially without a light.
They sat side by side outside the window, whispering and listening.
In half an hour the moon rose over the wood.
It shone full and clear and cold, upon the house, amongst the rocks, and in at the kitchen window.
But alas, no little rabbit babies were to be seen!
The moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor.
The light showed a little door in a wall beside the kitchen fireplace --a little iron door belonging to a brick oven of that old-fashioned sort that used to be heated with faggots of wood.
And presently at the same moment Peter and Benjamin noticed that whenever they shook the window the little door opposite shook in answer.
The young family were alive; shut up in the oven!
Benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake Tommy Brock, whose snores continued solemnly in Mr. Tod's bed.
But there really was not very much comfort in the discovery.
They could not open the window; and although the young family was alive the little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not old enough to crawl.
After much whispering, Peter and Benjamin decided to dig a tunnel.
They began to burrow a yard or two lower down the bank.
They hoped that they might be able to work between the large stones under the house; the kitchen floor was so dirty that it was impossible to say whether it was made of earth or flags.
They dug and dug for hours.
They could not tunnel straight on account of stones; but by the end of the night they were under the kitchen floor.
Benjamin was on his back scratching upwards.
Peter's claws were worn down; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away.
He called out that it was morning--sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods.
Benjamin Bunny came out of the dark tunnel shaking the sand from his ears; he cleaned his face with his paws.
Every minute the sun shone warmer on the top of the hill.
In the valley there was a sea of white mist, with golden tops of trees showing through.
Again from the fields down below in the mist there came the angry cry of a jay, followed by the sharp yelping bark of a fox!
Then those two rabbits lost their heads completely.
They did the most foolish thing that they could have done.
They rushed into their short new tunnel, and hid themselves at the top end of it, under Mr. Tod's kitchen floor.
Mr. Tod was coming up Bull Banks, and he was in the very worst of tempers.
First he had been upset by breaking the plate.
It was his own fault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother, old Vixen Tod.
Then the midges had been very bad.
And he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it had contained only five eggs, two of them addled.
Mr. Tod had had an unsatisfactory night.
As usual, when out of humor, he determined to move house.
First he tried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a dead fish near it.
Mr. Tod likes nobody's leavings but his own.
He made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger.
No one else grubs up the moss so wantonly as Tommy Brock.
Mr. Tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where Tommy Brock had gone to.
He was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently.
It flew from tree to tree and scolded, warning every rabbit within hearing that either a cat or a fox was coming up the plantation.
Once when it flew screaming over his head Mr. Tod snapped at it, and barked.
He approached his house very carefully, with a large rusty key.
He sniffed and his whiskers bristled.
The house was locked up, but Mr. Tod had his doubts whether it was empty.
He turned the rusty key in the lock; the rabbits below could hear it.
Mr. Tod opened the door cautiously and went in.
The sight that met Mr. Tod's eyes in Mr. Tod's kitchen made Mr. Tod furious.
There was Mr. Tod's chair, and Mr. Tod's pie dish, and his knife and fork and mustard and salt cellar, and his tablecloth, that he had left folded up in the dresser --all set out for supper (or breakfast) --without doubt for that odious Tommy Brock.
There was a smell of fresh earth and dirty badger, which fortunately overpowered all smell of rabbit.
But what absorbed Mr. Tod's attention was a noise, a deep slow regular snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed.
He peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door.
Then he turned and came out of the house in a hurry.
His whiskers bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage.
For the next twenty minutes Mr. Tod kept creeping cautiously into the house, and retreating hurriedly out again.
By degrees he ventured further in--right into the bed- room.
When he was outside the house, he scratched up the earth with fury.
But when he was inside --he did not like the look of Tommy Brock's teeth.
He was lying on his back with his mouth open, grinning from ear to ear.
He snored peacefully and regularly; but one eye was not perfectly shut.
Mr. Tod came in and out of the bedroom.
Twice he brought in his walking stick, and once he brought in the coal scuttle.
But he thought better of it, and took them away.
When he came back after removing the coal scuttle, Tommy Brock was lying a little more sideways; but he seemed even sounder asleep.
He was an incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of Mr. Tod; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move.
Mr. Tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line.
He stood a minute watching Tommy Brock and listening attentively to the snores.
They were very loud indeed, but seemed quite natural.
Mr. Tod turned his back towards the bed, and undid the window.
It creaked; he turned round with a jump.
Tommy Brock, who had opened one eye--shut it hastily.
The snores continued.
Mr. Tod's proceedings were peculiar, and rather difficult (because the bed was between the window and the door of the bedroom).
He opened the window a little way, and pushed out the greater part of the clothes line on to the window- sill.
The rest of the line, with a hook at the end, remained in his hand.
Tommy Brock snored conscientiously.
Mr. Tod stood and looked at him for a minute; then he left the room again.
Tommy Brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned.
There was a noise outside the window.
Tommy Brock shut his eyes in a hurry.
Mr. Tod had gone out at the front door, and round to the back of the house.
On the way, he stumbled over the rabbit burrow.
If he had had any idea who was inside it he would have pulled them out quickly.
His foot went through the tunnel nearly upon the top of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin; but, fortunately, he thought that it was some more of Tommy Brock's work.
He took up the coil of line from the sill, listened for a moment, and then tied the rope to a tree.
Tommy Brock watched him with one eye, through the window.
He was puzzled.
Mr. Tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom.
Tommy Brock snored industriously, with rather a snort.
Mr. Tod put down the pail beside the bed, took up the end of rope with the hook--hesitated, and looked at Tommy Brock.
The snores were almost apoplectic; but the grin was not quite so big.
Mr. Tod gingerly mounted a chair by the head of the bedstead.
His legs were dangerously near to Tommy Brock's teeth.
He reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang.
(Mr.
Tod's curtains were folded up, and put away, owing to the house being unoccupied.
So was the counterpane.
Tommy Brock was covered with a blanket only.)
Mr. Tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper!
It seemed as though nothing would waken him--not even the flapping rope across the bed.
Mr. Tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavored to get up again with the pail of water.
He intended to hang it from the hook, dangling over the head of Tommy Brock, in order to make a sort of shower-bath, worked by a string, through the window.
But, naturally, being a thin- legged person (though vindictive and sandy whiskered)--he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope.
He very nearly overbalanced himself.
The snores became more and more apoplectic.
One of Tommy Brock's hind legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully.
Mr. Tod and the pail descended from the chair without accident.
After considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash basin and jug.
The empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over the head of Tommy Brock.
Surely there never was such a sleeper!
Mr. Tod got up and down, down and up on the chair.
As he could not lift the whole pailful of water at once he fetched a milk jug and ladled quarts of water into the pail by degrees.
The pail got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum.
Occasionally a drop splashed over; but still Tommy Brock snored regularly and never moved,--except in one eye.
At last Mr. Tod's preparations were complete.
The pail was full of water; the rope was tightly strained over the top of the bed, and across the windowsill to the tree outside.
"It will make a great mess in my bedroom; but I could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort," said Mr. Tod.
Mr. Tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room.
He went out of the house, shutting the front door.
The rabbits heard his footsteps over the tunnel.
He ran round behind the house, intending to undo the rope in order to let fall the pailful of water upon Tommy Brock--
"I will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise," said Mr. Tod.
The moment he had gone, Tommy Brock got up in a hurry; he rolled Mr. Tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also-- grinning immensely.
He went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits.
When Mr. Tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying.
He was obliged to gnaw it with his teeth.
He chewed and gnawed for more than twenty minutes.
At last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards.
Inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a pail rolling over and over.
But no screams.
Mr. Tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened attentively.
Then he peeped in at the window.
The water was dripping from the bed, the pail had rolled into a corner.
In the middle of the bed, under the blanket, was a wet SOMETHING --much flattened in the middle, where the pail had caught it (as it were across the tummy).
Its head was covered by the wet blanket, and it was NOT SNORING ANY LONGER.
There was nothing stirring, and no sound except the drip, drop, drop, drip, of water trickling from the mattress.
Mr. Tod watched it for half an hour; his eyes glistened.
Then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the window; but the bundle never moved.
Yes--there was no doubt about it--it had turned out even better than he had planned; the pail had hit poor old Tommy Brock, and killed him dead!
"I will bury that nasty person in the hole which he has dug.
I will bring my bedding out, and dry it in the sun," said Mr. Tod.
"I will wash the tablecloth and spread it on the grass in the sun to bleach.
And the blanket must be hung up in the wind; and the bed must be thoroughly disinfected, and aired with a warming-pan; and warmed with a hot water bottle."
"I will get soft soap, and monkey soap, and all sorts of soap; and soda and scrubbing brushes; and persian powder; and carbolic to remove the smell.
I must have a disinfecting.
Perhaps I may have to burn sulphur."
He hurried round the house to get a shovel from the kitchen-- "First I will arrange the hole--then I will drag out that person in the blanket.
. . ."
He opened the door.
. . .
Tommy Brock was sitting at Mr. Tod's kitchen table, pouring out tea from Mr. Tod's teapot into Mr. Tod's teacup.
He was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over Mr. Tod.
Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock grappled with Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, and there was a terrific battle all over the kitchen.
To the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture.
They crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously.
Inside the house the racket was fearful.
The rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside.
Everything was upset except the kitchen table.
And everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender.
The crockery was smashed to atoms.
The chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash, and there were handfuls of Mr. Tod's sandy whiskers.
The vases fell off the mantelpiece, the cannisters fell off the shelf; the kettle fell off the hob.
Tommy Brock put his foot in a jar of raspberry jam.
And the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of Mr. Tod.
When the kettle fell, Tommy Brock, who was still grinning, happened to be uppermost; and he rolled Mr. Tod over and over like a log, out at the door.
Then the snarling and worrying went on outside; and they rolled over the bank, and down hill, bumping over the rocks.
There will never be any love lost between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.
As soon as the coast was clear, Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny came out of the bushes.
"Now for it!
Run in, Cousin Benjamin!
Run in and get them! while I watch the door."
But Benjamin was frightened--
"Oh; oh! they are coming back!"
"No they are not."
"Yes they are!"
"What dreadful bad language!
I think they have fallen down the stone quarry."
Still Benjamin hesitated, and Peter kept pushing him--
"Be quick, it's all right.
Shut the oven door, Cousin Benjamin, so that he won't miss them."
Decidedly there were lively doings in Mr. Tod's kitchen!
At home in the rabbit hole, things had not been quite comfortable.
After quarreling at supper, Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer had passed a sleepless night, and quarrelled again at breakfast.
Old Mr. Bouncer could no longer deny that he had invited company into the rabbit hole; but he refused to reply to the questions and reproaches of Flopsy.
The day passed heavily.
Old Mr. Bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with a chair.
Flopsy had taken away his pipe and hidden the tobacco.
She had been having a complete turn out and spring cleaning, to relieve her feelings.
She had just finished.
Old Mr. Bouncer, behind his chair, was wondering anxiously what she would do next.
In Mr. Tod's kitchen, amidst the wreckage, Benjamin Bunny picked his way to the oven nervously, through a thick cloud of dust.
He opened the oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling.
He lifted it out carefully, and rejoined Peter Rabbit.
"I've got them!
Can we get away?
Shall we hide, Cousin Peter?"
Peter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood.
Five minutes afterwards two breathless rabbits came scuttering away down Bull Banks, half carrying, half dragging a sack between them, bumpetty bump over the grass.
They reached home safely, and burst into the rabbit hole.
Great was old Mr. Bouncer's relief and Flopsy's joy when Peter and Benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family.
The rabbit babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed.
They soon recovered.
A new long pipe and a fresh supply of rabbit tobacco was presented to Mr. Bouncer.
He was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted.
Old Mr. Bouncer was forgiven, and they all had dinner.
Then Peter and Benjamin told their story--but they had not waited long enough to be able to tell the end of the battle between Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod.
Once upon a time there was a little girl called Lucie, who lived at a farm called Little-town.
She was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!
One day little Lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so!
"I've lost my pocket-handkin!
Three handkins and a pinny!
Have YOU seen them, Tabby Kitten?"
The Kitten went on washing her white paws; so Lucie asked a speckled hen--
"Sally Henny-penny, have YOU found three pocket-handkins?"
But the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--
"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!"
And then Lucie asked Cock Robin sitting on a twig.
Cock Robin looked sideways at Lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.
Lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind Little- town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!
And a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.
Lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her short legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until Little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!
Presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hillside.
Some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg- cup!
And where the sand upon the path was wet--there were footmarks of a VERY small person.
Lucie ran on, and on.
The path ended under a big rock.
The grass was short and green, and there were clothes-props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!
But there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--
"Lily-white and clean, oh!
With little frills between, oh!
Smooth and hot-red rusty spot Never here be seen, oh!"
Lucie knocked-once-twice, and interrupted the song.
A little frightened voice called out "Who's that?"
Lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams-- just like any other farm kitchen.
Only the ceiling was so low that Lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.
There was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand, stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at Lucie.
Her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat.
Her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap-where Lucie had yellow curls-that little person had PRICKLES!
"Who are you?" said Lucie.
"Have you seen my pocket-handkins?"
The little person made a bob- curtsey--"Oh yes, if you please'm; my name is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle; oh yes if you please'm, I'm an excellent clear- starcher!"
And she took something out of the clothesbasket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.
"What's that thing?" said Lucie- "that's not my pocket-handkin?"
"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to Cock Robin!"
And she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.
Then she took something else off a clothes-horse--"That isn't my pinny?" said Lucie.
"Oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to Jenny Wren; look how it's stained with currant wine!
It's very bad to wash!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.
"There's one of my pocket- handkins!" cried Lucie--"and there's my pinny!"
Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.
"Oh that IS lovely!" said Lucie.
"And what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?"
"Oh that's a pair of stockings belonging to Sally Henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard!
She'll very soon go barefoot!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
"Why, there's another hankersniff-- but it isn't mine; it's red?"
"Oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old Mrs. Rabbit; and it DID so smell of onions!
I've had to wash it separately, I can't get out that smell."
"There's another one of mine," said Lucie.
"What are those funny little white things?"
"That's a pair of mittens belonging to Tabby Kitten; I only have to iron them; she washes them herself."
"There's my last pocket-handkin!" said Lucie.
"And what are you dipping into the basin of starch?"
"They're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to Tom Titmouse--most terrible particular!" said Mrs. Tiggy- winkle.
"Now I've finished my ironing; I'm going to air some clothes."
"What are these dear soft fluffy things?" said Lucie.
"Oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at Skelghyl."
"Will their jackets take off?" asked Lucie.
"Oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder.
And here's one marked for Gatesgarth, and three that come from Little-town.
They're ALWAYS marked at washing!" said Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
And she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to Squirrel Nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to Peter Rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!
Then Mrs. Tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for Lucie.
They sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another.
Mrs. Tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were HAIRPINS sticking wrong end out; so that Lucie didn't like to sit too near her.
When they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and Lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.
And then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.
Then away down the hill trotted Lucie and Mrs. Tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!
All the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny!
And she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.
So that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except Lucie's one little bundle.
Lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say "Good-night," and to thank the washer-woman.--But what a VERY odd thing!
Mrs. Tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!
She was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown-and her petticoat?
And HOW small she had grown-- and HOW brown--and covered with PRICKLES!
Why!
Mrs. Tiggy-winkle was nothing but a HEDGEHOG! * * * * * *
(Now some people say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile--but then how could she have found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?
And besides--I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Cat Bells--and besides _I_ am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!)
Once upon a time there was a woodmouse, and her name was Mrs. Tittlemouse.
She lived in a bank under a hedge.
Such a funny house!
There were yards and yards of sandy passages, leading to store- rooms and nut cellars and seed cellars, all amongst the roots of the hedge.
There was a kitchen, a parlor, a pantry, and a larder.
Also, there was Mrs. Tittle- mouse's bedroom, where she slept in a little box bed!
Mrs. Tittlemouse was a most terribly tidy particular little mouse, always sweeping and dusting the soft sandy floors.
Sometimes a beetle lost its way in the passages.
"Shuh! shuh! little dirty feet!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse, clattering her dustpan.
And one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak.
"Your house is on fire, Mother Ladybird!
Fly away home to your children!"
Another day, a big fat spider came in to shelter from the rain.
"Beg pardon, is this not Miss Muffet's?"
"Go away, you bold bad spider!
Leaving ends of cobweb all over my nice clean house!"
She bundled the spider out at a window.
He let himself down the hedge with a long thin bit of string.
Mrs. Tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherrystones and thistle- down seed for dinner.
All along the passage she sniffed, and looked at the floor.
"I smell a smell of honey; is it the cowslips outside, in the hedge?
I am sure I can see the marks of little dirty feet."
Suddenly round a corner, she met Babbitty Bumble--"Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz!" said the bumble bee.
Mrs. Tittlemouse looked at her severely.
She wished that she had a broom.
"Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I should be glad to buy some bees- wax.
But what are you doing down here?
Why do you always come in at a window, and say, Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?"
Mrs. Tittle- mouse began to get cross.
"Zizz, Wizz, Wizzz!" replied Babbitty Bumble in a peevish squeak.
She sidled down a passage, and disappeared into a storeroom which had been used for acorns.
Mrs. Tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before Christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty.
But it was full of untidy dry moss.
Mrs. Tittlemouse began to pull out the moss.
Three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely.
"I am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.
"I will have them turned out --" "Buzz!
Buzz!
Buzzz!"--"I wonder who would help me?"
"Bizz, Wizz, Wizzz!"
--"I will not have Mr. Jackson; he never wipes his feet."
Mrs. Tittlemouse decided to leave the bees till after dinner.
When she got back to the parlor, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself.
He was sitting all over a small rocking chair, twiddling his thumbs and smiling, with his feet on the fender.
He lived in a drain below the hedge, in a very dirty wet ditch.
"How do you do, Mr. Jackson?
Deary me, you have got very wet!"
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
I'll sit awhile and dry myself," said Mr. Jackson.
He sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails.
Mrs. Tittlemouse went round with a mop.
He sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner?
First she offered him cherry- stones.
"Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
No teeth, no teeth, no teeth!" said Mr. Jackson.
He opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head.
Then she offered him thistle- down seed--"Tiddly, widdly, widdly!
Pouff, pouff, puff." said Mr. Jackson.
He blew the thistle- down all over the room.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mrs. Tittlemouse!
Now what I really--REALLY should like-- would be a little dish of honey!"
"I am afraid I have not got any, Mr. Jackson!" said Mrs. Tittlemouse.
"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!" said the smiling Mr. Jackson, "I can SMELL it; that is why I came to call."
Mr. Jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards.
Mrs. Tittlemouse followed him with a dishcloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlor floor.
When he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage.
"Indeed, indeed, you will stick fast, Mr. Jackson!"
"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"
First he squeezed into the pantry.
"Tiddly, widdly, widdly?
No honey?
No honey, Mrs. Tittlemouse?"
There were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate rack.
Two of them got away; but the littlest one he caught.
Then he squeezed into the larder.
Miss Butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window.
"Tiddly, widdly, widdly, Mrs. Tittlemouse; you seem to have plenty of visitors!"
"And without any invitation!" said Mrs. Thomasina Tittlemouse.
They went along the sandy passage--"Tiddly, widdly--" "Buzz!
Wizz!
Wizz!"
He met Babbitty round a corner, and snapped her up, and put her down again.
"I do not like bumble bees.
They are all over bristles," said Mr. Jackson, wiping his mouth with his coat sleeve.
"Get out, you nasty old toad!" shrieked Babbitty Bumble.
"I shall go distracted!" scolded Mrs. Tittlemouse.
She shut herself up in the nut cellar while Mr. Jackson pulled out the bees-nest.
He seemed to have no objection to stings.
When Mrs. Tittlemouse ventured to come out--everybody had gone away.
But the untidiness was something dreadful--"Never did I see such a mess--smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown--and marks of big and little dirty feet-- all over my nice clean house!"
She gathered up the moss and the remains of the bees- wax.
Then she went out and fetched some twigs, to partly close up the front door.
"I will make it too small for Mr. Jackson!"
She fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom.
But she was too tired to do any more.
First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.
"Will it ever be tidy again?" said poor Mrs. Tittlemouse.
Next morning she got up very early and began a spring cleaning which lasted a fort- night.
She swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with bees- wax, and polished her little tin spoons.
When it was all beautifully neat and clean, she gave a party to five other little mice, without Mr. Jackson.
He smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door.
So they handed him out acorn cupfuls of honeydew through the window, and he was not at all offended.
He sat outside in the sun, and said--"Tiddly, widdly, widdly!
Your very good health, Mrs. Tittlemouse!"
Once upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names were-- Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.
They lived with their Mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.
"Now, my dears," said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, "you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor."
"Now run along, and don't get into mischief.
I am going out."
Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's.
She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.
Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries;
But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!
First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes;
And then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.
But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!
Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, "Stop thief."
Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.
He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.
After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.
It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.
Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.
Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.
And rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can.
It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.
Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower- pot.
He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.
Presently Peter sneezed-- "Kertyschoo!"
Mr. McGregor was after him in no time,
And tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants.
The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter.
He went back to his work.
Peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go.
Also he was very damp with sitting in that can.
After a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all around.
He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.
An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood.
Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer.
She only shook her head at him.
Peter began to cry.
Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled.
Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water-cans.
A white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive.
Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he has heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.
He went back towards the toolshed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe-- scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.
Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.
But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over.
The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing onions.
His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate!
Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.
Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care.
He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.
Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.
Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.
He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes.
His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.
It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!
I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.
His mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!
"One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time."
But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper.
Once upon a time there was an old pig called Aunt Pettitoes.
She had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called Cross-patch, Suck-suck, Yock-yock and Spot; and four little boy pigs, called Alexander, Pigling Bland, Chin-Chin and Stumpy.
Stumpy had had an accident to his tail.
The eight little pigs had very fine appetites--"Yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they DO eat!" said Aunt Pettitoes, looking at her family with pride.
Suddenly there were fearful squeals; Alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck.
Aunt Pettitoes and I dragged him out by the hind legs.
Chin-chin was already in disgrace; it was washing day, and he had eaten a piece of soap.
And presently in a basket of clean clothes, we found another dirty little pig--"Tchut, tut, tut! whichever is this?" grunted Aunt Pettitoes.
Now all the pig family are pink, or pink with black spots, but this pig child was smutty black all over; when it had been popped into a tub, it proved to be Yock-yock.
I went into the garden; there I found Cross-patch and Suck-suck rooting up carrots.
I whipped them myself and led them out by the ears.
Cross-patch tried to bite me.
"Aunt Pettitoes, Aunt Pettitoes! you are a worthy person, but your family is not well brought up.
Every one of them has been in mischief except Spot and Pigling Bland."
"Yus, yus!" sighed Aunt Pettitoes.
"And they drink bucketfuls of milk; I shall have to get another cow!
Good little Spot shall stay at home to do the housework; but the others must go.
Four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether."
"Yus, yus, yus," said Aunt Pettitoes, "there will be more to eat without them."
So Chin-chin and Suck-suck went away in a wheel-barrow, and Stumpy, Yock-yock and Cross- patch rode away in a cart.
And the other two little boy pigs, Pigling Bland and Alexander went to market.
We brushed their coats, we curled their tails and washed their little faces, and wished them good bye in the yard.
Aunt Pettitoes wiped her eyes with a large pocket handkerchief, then she wiped Pigling Bland's nose and shed tears; then she wiped Alexander's nose and shed tears; then she passed the handkerchief to Spot.
Aunt Pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows--
"Now Pigling Bland, son Pigling Bland, you must go to market.
Take your brother Alexander by the hand.
Mind your Sunday clothes, and remember to blow your nose" --(Aunt Pettitoes passed round the handkerchief again)--"beware of traps, hen roosts, bacon and eggs; always walk upon your hind legs."
Pigling Bland who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek.
Aunt Pettitoes turned to the other--"Now son Alexander take the hand"--"Wee, wee, wee!" giggled Alexander--"take the hand of your brother Pigling Bland, you must go to market.
Mind--" "Wee, wee, wee!" interrupted Alexander again.
"You put me out," said Aunt Pettitoes--"Observe signposts and milestones; do not gobble herring bones--" "And remember," said I impressively, "if you once cross the county boundary you cannot come back.
Alexander, you are not attending.
Here are two licenses permitting two pigs to go to market in Lancashire.
Attend Alexander.
I have had no end of trouble in getting these papers from the policeman."
Pigling Bland listened gravely; Alexander was hopelessly volatile.
I pinned the papers, for safety, inside their waistcoat pockets; Aunt Pettitoes gave to each a little bundle, and eight conversation peppermints with appropriate moral sentiments in screws of paper.
Then they started.
Pigling Bland and Alexander trotted along steadily for a mile; at least Pigling Bland did.
Alexander made the road half as long again by skipping from side to side.
He danced about and pinched his brother, singing--
"This pig went to market, this pig stayed at home, "This pig had a bit of meat--
let's see what they have given US for dinner, Pigling?"
Pigling Bland and Alexander sat down and untied their bundles.
Alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time; he had already eaten all his own peppermints--"Give me one of yours, please, Pigling?"
"But I wish to preserve them for emergencies," said Pigling Bland doubtfully.
Alexander went into squeals of laughter.
Then he pricked Pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when Pigling slapped him he dropped the pin, and tried to take Pigling's pin, and the papers got mixed up.
Pigling Bland reproved Alexander.
But presently they made it up again, and trotted away together, singing--
"Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig and away he ran!
"But all the tune that he could play, was `Over the hills and far away!'"
"What's that, young Sirs?
Stole a pig?
Where are your licenses?" said the policeman.
They had nearly run against him round a corner.
Pigling Bland pulled out his paper; Alexander, after fumbling, handed over something scrumply--
"To 2 1/2 oz. conversation sweeties at three farthings"--"What's this? this ain't a license?"
Alexander's nose lengthened visibly, he had lost it.
"I had one, indeed I had, Mr. Policeman!"
"It's not likely they let you start without.
I am passing the farm.
You may walk with me."
"Can I come back too?" inquired Pigling Bland.
"I see no reason, young Sir; your paper is all right."
Pigling Bland did not like going on alone, and it was beginning to rain.
But it is unwise to argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight.
To conclude the adventures of Alexander--the policeman sauntered up to the house about tea time, followed by a damp subdued little pig.
I disposed of Alexander in the neighborhood; he did fairly well when he had settled down.
Pigling Bland went on alone dejectedly; he came to cross roads and a sign-post--"To Market-town 5 miles," "Over the Hills, 4 miles," "To Pettitoes Farm, 3 miles."
Pigling Bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in Market Town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of Alexander.
He glanced wistfully along the road towards the hills, and then set off walking obediently the other way, buttoning up his coat against the rain.
He had never wanted to go; and the idea of standing all by himself in a crowded market, to be stared at, pushed, and hired by some big strange farmer was very disagreeable--
"I wish I could have a little garden and grow potatoes," said Pigling Bland.
He put his cold hand in his pocket and felt his paper, he put his other hand in his other pocket and felt another paper--Alexander's!
Pigling squealed; then ran back frantically, hoping to overtake Alexander and the policeman.
He took a wrong turn--several wrong turns, and was quite lost.
It grew dark, the wind whistled, the trees creaked and groaned.
Pigling Bland became frightened and cried "Wee, wee, wee!
I can't find my way home!"
After an hour's wandering he got out of the wood; the moon shone through the clouds, and Pigling Bland saw a country that was new to him.
The road crossed a moor; below was a wide valley with a river twinkling in the moonlight, and beyond --in misty distance--lay the hills.
He saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside --"I am afraid it IS a hen house, but what can I do?" said Pigling Bland, wet and cold and quite tired out.
"Bacon and eggs, bacon and eggs!" clucked a hen on a perch.
"Trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle!" scolded the disturbed cockerel.
"To market, to market! jiggettyjig!" clucked a broody white hen roosting next to him.
Pigling Bland, much alarmed, determined to leave at daybreak.
In the meantime, he and the hens fell asleep.
In less than an hour they were all awakened.
The owner, Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson, came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning.
He grabbed the white hen roosting next to the cock; then his eye fell upon Pigling Bland, squeezed up in a corner.
He made a singular remark--"Hallo, here's another!" --seized Pigling by the scruff of the neck, and dropped him into the hamper.
Then he dropped in five more dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of Pigling Bland.
The hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight; it was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks.
Pigling, although nearly scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes.
At last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor, the lid was opened, and Pigling was lifted out.
He looked up, blinking, and saw an offensively ugly elderly man, grinning from ear to ear.
"This one's come of himself, whatever," said Mr. Piperson, turning Pigling's pockets inside out.
He pushed the hamper into a corner, threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and unlaced his boots.
Pigling Bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it, shyly warming his hands.
Mr. Piperson pulled off a boot and threw it against the wainscot at the further end of the kitchen.
There was a smothered noise--"Shut up!" said Mr. Piperson.
Pigling Bland warmed his hands, and eyed him.
Mr. Piperson pulled off the other boot and flung it after the first, there was again a curious noise-- "Be quiet, will ye?" said Mr. Piperson.
Pigling Bland sat on the very edge of the coppy stool.
Mr. Piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge, it seemed to Pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a suppressed interest in the cooking; but he was too hungry to be troubled by noises.
Mr. Piperson poured out three platefuls: for himself, for Pigling, and a third-after glaring at Pigling-- he put away with much scuffling, and locked up.
Pigling Bland ate his supper discreetly.
After supper Mr. Piperson consulted an almanac, and felt Pigling's ribs; it was too late in the season for curing bacon, and he grudged his meal.
Besides, the hens had seen this pig.
He looked at the small remains of a flitch [side of bacon], and then looked undecidedly at Pigling.
"You may sleep on the rug," said Mr. Peter Thomas Piperson.
Pigling Bland slept like a top.
In the morning Mr. Piperson made more porridge; the weather was warmer.
He looked how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied--"You'll likely be moving on again?" said he to Pigling Bland.
Before Pigling could reply, a neighbor, who was giving Mr. Piperson and the hens a lift, whistled from the gate.
Mr. Piperson hurried out with the hamper, enjoining Pigling to shut the door behind him and not meddle with nought; or "I'll come back and skin ye!" said Mr. Piperson.
It crossed Pigling's mind that if HE had asked for a lift, too, he might still have been in time for market.
But he distrusted Peter Thomas.
After finishing breakfast at his leisure, Pigling had a look round the cottage; everything was locked up.
He found some potato peelings in a bucket in the back kitchen.
Pigling ate the peel, and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket.
He sang while he worked--
"Tom with his pipe made such a noise, He called up all the girls and boys-- "And they all ran to hear him play, "Over the hills and far away!--"
Suddenly a little smothered voice chimed in--
"Over the hills and a great way off, The wind shall blow my top knot off."
Pigling Bland put down a plate which he was wiping, and listened.
After a long pause, Pigling went on tiptoe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen; there was nobody there.
After another pause, Pigling approached the door of the locked cupboard, and snuffed at the keyhole.
It was quite quiet.
After another long pause, Pigling pushed a peppermint under the door.
It was sucked in immediately.
In the course of the day Pigling pushed in all his remaining six peppermints.
When Mr. Piperson returned, he found Pigling sitting before the fire; he had brushed up the hearth and put on the pot to boil; the meal was not get-at-able.
Mr. Piperson was very affable; he slapped Pigling on the back, made lots of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest.
He did lock the cupboard door; but without properly shutting it.
He went to bed early, and told Pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock.
Pigling Bland sat by the fire, eating his supper.
All at once at his elbow, a little voice spoke--"My name is Pig-wig.
Make me more porridge, please!"
Pigling Bland jumped, and looked round.
A perfectly lovely little black Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him.
She had twinkly little screwed up eyes, a double chin, and a short turned up nose.
She pointed at Pigling's plate; he hastily gave it to her, and fled to the meal chest--"How did you come here?" asked Pigling Bland.
"Stolen," replied Pig-wig, with her mouth full.
Pigling helped himself to meal without scruple.
"What for?"
"Bacon, hams," replied Pig- wig cheerfully.
"Why on earth don't you run away?" exclaimed the horrified Pigling.
"I shall after supper," said Pig- wig decidedly.
Pigling Bland made more porridge and watched her shyly.
She finished a second plate, got up, and looked about her, as though she were going to start.
"You can't go in the dark," said Pigling Bland.
Pig-wig looked anxious.
"Do you know your way by day- light?"
"I know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river.
Which way are _you_ going, Mr. Pig?"
"To market--I have two pig papers.
I might take you to the bridge; if you have no objection," said Pigling much confused and sitting on the edge of his coppy stool.
Pig- wig's gratitude was such and she asked so many questions that it became embarrassing to Pigling Bland.
He was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep.
She became quiet, and there was a smell of peppermint.
"I thought you had eaten them?" said Pigling, waking suddenly.
"Only the corners," replied Pig- wig, studying the sentiments with much interest by the firelight.
"I wish you wouldn't; he might smell them through the ceiling," said the alarmed Pigling.
Pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket; "Sing something," she demanded.
"I am sorry.
. .
I have tooth- ache," said Pigling much dismayed.
"Then I will sing," replied Pig- wig, "You will not mind if I say iddy tidditty?
I have forgotten some of the words."
Pigling Bland made no objection; he sat with his eyes half shut, and watched her.
She wagged her head and rocked about, clapping time and singing in a sweet little grunty voice--
"A funny old mother pig lived in a stye, and three little piggies had she; "(Ti idditty idditty) umph, umph, umph! and the little pigs said wee, wee!"
She sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse her head nodded a little lower, and her little twinkly eyes closed up--
"Those three little piggies grew peaky and lean, and lean they might very well be; "For somehow they couldn't say umph, umph, umph! and they wouldn't say wee, wee, wee!
"For somehow they couldn't say--
Pig-wig's head bobbed lower and lower, until she rolled over, a little round ball, fast asleep on the hearth-rug.
Pigling Bland, on tiptoe, covered her up with an antimacassar.
He was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of Mr. Piperson overhead.
Early in the morning, between dark and daylight, Pigling tied up his little bundle and woke up Pig- wig.
She was excited and half- frightened.
"But it's dark!
How can we find our way?"
"The cock has crowed; we must start before the hens come out; they might shout to Mr. Piperson."
Pig-wig sat down again, and commenced to cry.
"Come away Pig-wig; we can see when we get used to it.
Come!
I can hear them clucking!"
Pigling had never said shuh! to a hen in his life, being peaceable; also he remembered the hamper.
He opened the house door quietly and shut it after them.
There was no garden; the neighborhood of Mr. Piperson's was all scratched up by fowls.
They slipped away hand in hand across an untidy field to the road.
"Tom, Tom the piper's son, stole a pig and away he ran!
"But all the tune that he could play, was `Over the hills and far away!'"
"Come Pig-wig, we must get to the bridge before folks are stirring."
"Why do you want to go to market, Pigling?" inquired Pig-wig.
The sun rose while they were crossing the moor, a dazzle of light over the tops of the hills.
The sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys, where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards.
"That's Westmorland," said Pig- wig.
She dropped Pigling's hand and commenced to dance, singing-- presently.
"I don't want; I want to grow potatoes."
"Have a peppermint?" said Pig-wig.
Pigling Bland refused quite crossly.
"Does your poor toothy hurt?" inquired Pig- wig.
Pigling Bland grunted.
Pig-wig ate the peppermint herself, and followed the opposite side of the road.
"Pig-wig! keep under the wall, there's a man ploughing."
Pig-wig crossed over, they hurried down hill towards the county boundary.
Suddenly Pigling stopped; he heard wheels.
Slowly jogging up the road below them came a tradesman's cart.
The reins flapped on the horse's back, the grocer was reading a newspaper.
"Take that peppermint out of your mouth, Pig-wig, we may have to run.
Don't say one word.
Leave it to me.
And in sight of the bridge!" said poor Pigling, nearly crying.
He began to walk frightfully lame, holding Pig-wig's arm.
The grocer, intent upon his newspaper, might have passed them, if his horse had not shied and snorted.
He pulled the cart crossways, and held down his whip.
"Hallo?
Where are you going to?"--Pigling Bland stared at him vacantly.
"Are you deaf?
Are you going to market?"
Pigling nodded slowly.
"I thought as much.
It was yesterday.
Show me your license?"
Pigling stared at the off hind shoe of the grocer's horse which had picked up a stone.
The grocer flicked his whip-- "Papers?
Pig license?"
Pigling fumbled in all his pockets, and handed up the papers.
The grocer read them, but still seemed dissatisfied.
"This here pig is a young lady; is her name Alexander?"
Pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again; Pigling coughed asthmatically.
The grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper--"Lost, stolen or strayed, 10S. reward;" he looked suspiciously at Pig-wig.
Then he stood up in the trap, and whistled for the ploughman.
"You wait here while I drive on and speak to him," said the grocer, gathering up the reins.
He knew that pigs are slippery; but surely, such a VERY lame pig could never run!
"Not yet, Pig-wig, he will look back."
The grocer did so; he saw the two pigs stock-still in the middle of the road.
Then he looked over at his horse's heels; it was lame also; the stone took some time to knock out, after he got to the ploughman.
"Now, Pig-wig, NOW!" said Pigling Bland.
Never did any pigs run as these pigs ran!
They raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge.
Little fat Pig- wig's petticoats fluttered, and her feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as she bounded and jumped.
They ran, and they ran, and they ran down the hill, and across a short cut on level green turf at the bottom, between pebble beds and rushes.
They came to the river, they came to the bridge--they crossed it hand in hand--then over the hills and far away she danced with Pigling Bland!
It is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is "soporific."
I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit.
They certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!
When Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy.
They had a large family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.
I do not remember the separate names of their children; they were generally called the "Flopsy Bunnies."
As there was not always quite enough to eat,--Benjamin used to borrow cabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.
Sometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.
When this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.
Mr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture.
There were jam pots and paper bags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always tasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two.
One day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had "shot" into flower.
The Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed themselves with lettuces.
By degrees, one after another, they were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.
Benjamin was not so much overcome as his children.
Before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies.
The little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun.
From the lawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing machine.
The blue- bottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse picked over the rubbish among the jam pots.
(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittle- mouse, a woodmouse with a long tail.)
She rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.
The mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.
While she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a heavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a sackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies!
Benjamin shrank down under his paper bag.
The mouse hid in a jam pot.
The little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of grass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.
They dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.
Mr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack.
He saw some funny little brown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings.
He stared at them for some time.
Presently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.
Mr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--
"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!" said he as he dropped them into his sack.
The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was turning them over in bed.
They stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up.
Mr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall.
He went to put away the mowing machine.
While he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came across the field.
She looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?
Then the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag off his head, and they told the doleful tale.
Benjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.
But Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person.
She nibbled a hole in the bottom corner of the sack.
The little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.
Their parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows, an old blackingbrush and two decayed turnips.
Then they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.
Mr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.
He carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.
The Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.
They watched him go into his house.
And then they crept up to the window to listen.
Mr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would have been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to have been inside it.
They could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--
"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!" said Mr. McGregor.
"Eh?
What's that?
What have they been spoiling now?" enquired Mrs. McGregor.
"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!" repeated Mr. McGregor, counting on his fingers --"one, two, three--"
"Don't you be silly: what do you mean, you silly old man?"
"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!" replied Mr. McGregor.
(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the windowsill.)
Mrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it.
She said she could feel six, but they must be OLD rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes.
"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak."
"Line your old cloak?" shouted Mr. McGregor--"I shall sell them and buy myself baccy!"
"Rabbit tobacco!
I shall skin them and cut off their heads."
Mrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside.
When she felt the vegetables she became very very angry.
She said that Mr. McGregor had "done it a purpose."
And Mr. McGregor was very angry too.
One of the rotten marrows came flying through the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.
It was rather hurt.
Then Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.
So Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her rabbit skins.
But next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough rabbit wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a pair of warm mittens.
Once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called Timmy Tiptoes.
He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.
Timmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and chuckled--"Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store for winter and spring."
Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch--"The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter."
"Then we shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in spring- time," replied prudent Timothy.
When Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other squirrels were there already.
Timmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly by themselves.
Every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts.
They carried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near the tree where they had built their nest.
When these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a woodpecker; the nuts rattled down--down--down inside.
"How shall you ever get them out again?
It is like a money box!" said Goody.
"I shall be much thinner before springtime, my love," said Timmy Tiptoes, peeping into the hole.
They did collect quantities-- because they did not lose them!
Squirrels who bury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot remember the place.
The most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail.
He began to dig, and he could not remember.
And then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight.
And other squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!
Unfortunately, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from bush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders.
There were several sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.
The first one sang--"Who's bin digging-up MY nuts?
Who's-been- digging-up MY nuts?"
And another sang--"Little bita bread and-NO-cheese!
Little bit-a- bread an'-NO-cheese!"
The squirrels followed and listened.
The first little bird flew into the bush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and it sang--"Who's-bin digging-up MY nuts?
Who's been digging-up MY-nuts?"
Timmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer.
It was only singing its natural song, and it meant nothing at all.
But when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy Tiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts.
The innocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a fright!
Timmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his nest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting-- "Who's-been digging-up MY-nuts?"
They caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in.
The hole was much too small for Timmy Tiptoes' figure.
They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they did not break his ribs.
"We will leave him here till he confesses," said Silvertail Squirrel and he shouted into the hole--"Who's- been-digging-up MY-nuts?"
Timmy Tiptoes made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon half a peck of nuts belonging to himself.
He lay quite stunned and still.
Goody Tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home.
She made a cup of tea for Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.
Goody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night.
Next morning she ventured back to the nut bushes to look for him; but the other unkind squirrels drove her away.
She wandered all over the wood, calling--
"Timmy Tiptoes!
Timmy Tip- toes!
Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?"
In the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses.
He found himself tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to be under ground.
Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him.
There was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better?
It was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap; and the house was full of provisions.
The Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the tree--"Besides, I found a few buried!"
It laughed and chuckled when it heard Timmy's story.
While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat quantities --"But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin myself?
My wife will be anxious!"
"Just another nut--or two nuts; let me crack them for you," said the Chipmunk.
Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and fatter!
Now Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself.
She did not put any more nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how they could be got out again.
She hid them under a tree root; they rattled down, down, down.
Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a decided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little striped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.
"It is getting perfectly full-up downstairs; the sitting room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has run away and left me.
What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?"
"I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not know that anybody lived here," said Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; "but where is Chippy Hackee?
My husband, Timmy Tiptoes, has run away too."
"I know where Chippy is; a little bird told me," said Mrs. Chippy Hackee.
She led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.
Down below there was a noise of nutcrackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together--
"My little old man and I fell out, How shall we bring this matter about?
Bring it about as well as you can, And get you gone, you little old man!"
"You could squeeze in, through that little round hole," said Goody Tiptoes.
"Yes, I could," said the Chipmunk, "but my husband, Chippy Hackee, bites!"
Down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang--
"For the diddlum day Day diddle durn di!
Day diddle diddle dum day!"
Then Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--"Timmy Tiptoes!
Oh fie, Timmy Tiptoes!"
And Timmy replied, "Is that you, Goody Tiptoes?
Why, certainly!"
He came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he could not get out.
Chippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down below and chuckled.
And so it went on for a fort- night; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.
Then Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.
But Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was uncomfortable.
At last a large bear came walking through the wood.
Perhaps he also was looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.
Chippy Hackee went home in a hurry!
And when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head; and he was more uncomfortable still.
And now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut store fastened up with a little padlock.
And whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings--"Who's-been-digging- up MY-nuts?
Who's been dig- ging-up MY-nuts?"
But nobody ever answers!
Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet.
They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.
But one day their mother--Mrs.
Tabitha Twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.
First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet).
Then she brushed their fur (this one is Mittens).
Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten).
Tom was very naughty, and he scratched.
Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas.
Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off.
His mother sewed them on again.
When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.
"Now keep your frocks clean, children!
You must walk on your hind legs.
Keep away from the dirty ash- pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pigsty and the Puddle- ducks."
Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily.
Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.
When they stood up there were several green smears!
"Let us climb up the rockery and sit on the garden wall," said Moppet.
They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.
Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers.
He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns and shedding buttons right and left.
He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.
Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.
While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat, paddle pat! and the three Puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step-- pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!
They stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens.
They had very small eyes and looked surprised.
Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.
Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall.
Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.
"Come!
Mr. Drake Puddle-duck," said Moppet.
"Come and help us to dress him!
Come and button up Tom!"
Mr. Drake Puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles.
But he put them on HIMSELF!
They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.
"It's a very fine morning!" said Mr. Drake Puddle-duck.
And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!
Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.
She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.
"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted," said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.
She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles-- which was not true.
Quite the contrary; they were not in bed: NOT in the least.
Somehow there were very extra-- ordinary noises overhead, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.
And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!
As for the Puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.
The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.
And Mr. Drake Puddle-duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.
Once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's-house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney.
It belonged to two Dolls called Lucinda and Jane; at least it belonged to Lucinda, but she never ordered meals.
Jane was the Cook; but she never did any cooking, because the dinner had been bought ready-made, in a box full of shavings.
There were two red lobsters and a ham, a fish, a pudding, and some pears and oranges.
They would not come off the plates, but they were extremely beautiful.
One morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator.
There was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet.
Presently there was a little scuffling, scratching noise in a corner near the fireplace, where there was a hole under the skirting-board.
Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment, and then popped it in again.
Tom Thumb was a mouse.
A minute afterwards, Hunca Munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box.
The doll's-house stood at the other side of the fire-place.
Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went cautiously across the hearthrug.
They pushed the front door--it was not fast.
Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room.
Then they squeaked with joy!
Such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table!
There were tin spoons, and lead knives and forks, and two dolly-chairs--all SO convenient!
Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham.
It was a beautiful shiny yellow, streaked with red.
The knife crumpled up and hurt him; he put his finger in his mouth.
"It is not boiled enough; it is hard.
You have a try, Hunca Munca."
Hunca Munca stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife.
"It's as hard as the hams at the cheesemonger's," said Hunca Munca.
The ham broke off the plate with a jerk, and rolled under the table.
"Let it alone," said Tom Thumb; "give me some fish, Hunca Munca!"
Hunca Munca tried every tin spoon in turn; the fish was glued to the dish.
Then Tom Thumb lost his temper.
He put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel--bang, bang, smash, smash!
The ham flew all into pieces, for underneath the shiny paint it was made of nothing but plaster!
Then there was no end to the rage and disappointment of Tom Thumb and Hunca Munca.
They broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears and the oranges.
As the fish would not come off the plate, they put it into the red-hot crinkly paper fire in the kitchen; but it would not burn either.
Tom Thumb went up the kitchen chimney and looked out at the top-- there was no soot.
While Tom Thumb was up the chimney, Hunca Munca had another disappointment.
She found some tiny canisters upon the dresser, labelled-- Rice--Coffee--Sago--but when she turned them upside down, there was nothing inside except red and blue beads.
Then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could--especially Tom Thumb!
He took Jane's clothes out of the chest of drawers in her bedroom, and he threw them out of the top floor window.
But Hunca Munca had a frugal mind.
After pulling half the feathers out of Lucinda's bolster, she remembered that she herself was in want of a feather bed.
With Tom Thumbs's assistance she carried the bolster downstairs, and across the hearth-rug.
It was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse- hole; but they managed it somehow.
Then Hunca Munca went back and fetched a chair, a book-case, a bird- cage, and several small odds and ends.
The book-case and the bird- cage refused to go into the mousehole.
Hunca Munca left them behind the coal-box, and went to fetch a cradle.
Hunca Munca was just returning with another chair, when suddenly there was a noise of talking outside upon the landing.
The mice rushed back to their hole, and the dolls came into the nursery.
What a sight met the eyes of Jane and Lucinda!
Lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and Jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled--but neither of them made any remark.
The book-case and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal- box--but Hunca Munca has got the cradle, and some of Lucinda's clothes.
She also has some useful pots and pans, and several other things.
The little girl that the doll's-house belonged to, said,--"I will get a doll dressed like a policeman!"
But the nurse said,--"I will set a mouse-trap!"
So that is the story of the two Bad Mice,--but they were not so very very naughty after all, because Tom Thumb paid for everything he broke.
He found a crooked sixpence under the hearth-rug; and upon Christmas Eve, he and Hunca Munca stuffed it into one of the stockings of Lucinda and Jane.
And very early every morning-- before anybody is awake--Hunca Munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the Dollies' house!
